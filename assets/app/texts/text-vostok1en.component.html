    <p id="first">On days like this Poznań was the cruellest of cities. It&rsquo;s hard to decide whether this was
        because of the twelve degrees of frost, the sharp sunlight, the motionless ice-bound white river, the snow lying
        on the roofs or a peculiar combination of these elements, but one could clearly sense that the city was streaked
        with a strange kind of anxiety, that its foundations were filled with elusive energy. You could swear it was
        about to suddenly break in half, and its northern and southern parts intended (just like jaws) to break away
        from the ground, rise towards each other with a violent movement and forcefully collide until Piątkowo&rsquo;s
        blocks of flats (like teeth) fitted between the tenements of Wilda.</p>

    <div class="text-separator"></div>

    <p>If you made, right along one of its walls, a longitudinal section through the pub Kisielice, on the left side of
        the colourful rectangle you could see a bar, the back of a bartender working behind the bar, a wall painted in
        vividly coloured stripes in the background, black-and-white prints on the wall, and further towards the right
        end of the section: empty tables, chairs, sofas. The only clients in the pub visible from this perspective were
        a man and a woman, in their late twenties by the looks of it, who sat on a soft couch by the right edge of the
        rectangular section and talked, smoking tremendous amounts of cigarettes.</p>
    <p>A cloud of grey smoke hung in the air, the woman talked about the seemingly never-ending winter, about chronic
        lack of sleep, she looked at a soaked poster with a deer on the window and ran her fingers through her short
        bright hair. When she spoke, she gesticulated wildly; while sitting, she constantly shifted; and when she was
        telling her companion about the preview she&rsquo;d been to in that gallery in Jeżyce district, about the
        stunning works she&rsquo;d seen there, she almost rose from the sofa.</p>
    <p>The man, on the other hand, mostly sat in silence, inhaling smoke, listening to his friend, smiling faintly, but
        when he finally spoke, he covered his mouth with a hand closed into a fist or massaged his thick dark eyebrow
        with a thumb and stared into the distance, which made him look unsure of what he was saying.</p>
    <p>While they were sitting, the pub was slowly filling up. Each time the door to the street opened, a piercing chill
        came in, covering in a flash the length of the stairs leading to the basement and permeating through a thick
        curtain which separated the pub&rsquo;s vestibule from the long colourful room. The man called the woman
        Weronika, while she addressed him as Wu. With the back of her hand, she stroked his few-day-old dark stubble and
        said it would&rsquo;ve been nice if Wu&rsquo;d moved his shapely arse again and gone to the bar for a beer. Or
        not, maybe she&rsquo;ll drink some wine, but only white, or better: white wine with sparkling water. And ice. Wu
        smiled, put out the cigarette, kissed Weronika on the forehead and rose from the table. She followed him with
        her eyes as he stepped deeper into the pub, and then kept looking with yearning at his almost two-metre-high
        body leaning against the counter, while he chatted with the bartender he apparently knew.</p>
    <p>When he came back, she was sitting on the couch, snuggled into its corner, shrouded in a greenish glow beaming
        from her phone, texting someone obstinately. Once she noticed Wu, she took her legs off the seat and, leaning
        over the phone, kept pressing the buttons for a while longer. Wu asked whether it was Jerzy, and Weronika
        replied that yes, that she was sorry and &mdash; after some hesitation &mdash; that it seemed she and Jerzy&rsquo;d
        got together again.</p>
    <p>In response to her friend&rsquo;s judgemental look she whined it was not that she&rsquo;d been planning it, it&rsquo;d
        just happened, and took the first sip. Wu sat down, wetted his lips with beer, put the glass down and tossed a
        rhetorical question into the dusky room, &lsquo;How many times can you get into the same shit?&rsquo;</p>
    <p>&lsquo;Look who&rsquo;s talking&rsquo;, she replied sulkily, moved closer to the armrest, as far as she could get
        away from Wu, whose face in turn twitched in a grimace, as if he had a retort on the tip of his tongue, but he
        remained silent.</p>
    <p>He lit a cigarette and inhaled the smoke. Weronika kept texting for a while, until she sighed, put down the phone
        and suggested that maybe at least the two of them should stop arguing about it. Anyway, she bets that before two
        weeks have passed, in this series of break-ups and make-ups, Jerzy and she will come back to where they started.
        He gave a conciliatory smile, kissed her on the temple and wrapped his arm around her shoulder only to withdraw
        it a moment later.</p>
    <p>They sat for a while, saying nothing, against the background of the wall painted in stripes of different shades
        of green, with black-and-white prints above their heads. Weronika smoked as well, pulled up her legs and they
        stayed like that almost motionless for a good few minutes, staring into the void and releasing occasional clouds
        of grey smoke from their lungs. Finally the thick curtain over the doorway opened, letting inside &mdash; in the
        company of a cold waft of air from the street &mdash; a woman of around forty.</p>
    <p>&lsquo;Olka!&rsquo; On seeing her, Weronika let out a shriek, jumped to her feet and ran towards the door to
        throw herself into the woman&rsquo;s arms.</p>
    <p>The forty-year-old found the time to say hello to her other friend at one of the tables, before she headed deeper
        into this colourful, half-greenish, half-reddish tunnel, which was indeed formed by the interior of Kisielice,
        and went to the bar. She came back to the table holding three beers, put them in front of her friends, then
        laughed, ran her hand through her dyed blond curls, smoked and sat on one of the chairs. She took off her warm
        white jacket, hung it on the back of the chair and &mdash; visibly amused for all this time &mdash; said that
        this thing with the attack is some deep shit, that there may be more any moment.</p>
    <p>Weronika told her to let it go. She&rsquo;s fed up of discussing this topic over and over, Olka&rsquo;d better
        tell her what she missed in Meskal yesterday.</p>
    <p>&lsquo;But the problem won&rsquo;t go away just because we&rsquo;ll pretend it doesn&rsquo;t exist. It&rsquo;s
        hard not to speak about it when such a, well, bomb hasn&rsquo;t happened in years. We thought we were living in
        boring times of peace, and there you have it&rsquo;.</p>
    <p>Weronika replied she had two days off in a row for the first time since who knows when and was really sick of
        hearing about that. Olka&rsquo;d better bollock her for getting back with Jerzy.</p>
    <p>&lsquo;You&rsquo;ve got back with Jerzy?&rsquo; Olka let out an honest, booming laugh, which infected the others
        a moment later. Then she changed the topic and asked Wu about the progress of his work on those washing machine
        instructions for use.</p>
    <p>Thankfully he&rsquo;s done with it. Now he&rsquo;s getting down to writing a truly fascinating spreadsheet user
        manual. Maybe he&rsquo;ll finally learn how to use a spreadsheet. He rubbed his eyebrow with his thumb again,
        sighed and said freelancing has surprisingly little to do with freedom. At the moment his life is reduced to
        typing the shit out of the keyboard. This is not what he imagined a few years ago.</p>
    <p>&lsquo;Oh, stop grumbling. You&rsquo;d prefer to work in a shop?&rsquo;</p>
    <p>Weronika laughed and said it&rsquo;s easy to say if you&rsquo;re a director of a thriving company. Olka&rsquo;d
        better tell her when the last time she visited the office was.</p>
    <p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t exaggerate. I sometimes drop by&rsquo;. Anyway, she&rsquo;s worked hard for that. If they don&rsquo;t
        like it, they should find a busier friend, but she&rsquo;s curious who&rsquo;s going to pay for all those
        drinks. &lsquo;Better tell me about that novel of yours&rsquo;.</p>
    <p>Wu told her to forget it, said he hadn&rsquo;t had the time lately and, frankly, he no longer liked what he&rsquo;d
        written so far. It seems he&rsquo;ll have to begin again from scratch, if he only finds some free time.</p>
    <p>Weronika remarked with a sneer he would&rsquo;ve had more free time, if he hadn&rsquo;t wandered from pub to pub
        every night, which Wu answered with a humorous &lsquo;fuck off&rsquo; only to put out the cigarette a moment
        later, announce he needed to take a leak, and rise from the table.</p>
    <p>Once he disappeared behind the curtain, Weronika started talking about how insanely wasted she&rsquo;d got the
        night before, totally blotto; she didn&rsquo;t remember much: the voices of drunken people, the smell of kebabs,
        the bright car lights, the piercing frost. She&rsquo;d met some guy &mdash; in Dragon, or earlier, in Kisielice
        &mdash; and they walked somewhere together across the market square towards Garbary Street, maybe to Mięsna,
        &rsquo;cause where else could they&rsquo;ve gone. When she woke up, she couldn&rsquo;t remember anything else,
        except for the image of small glowing pink rectangles she still has before her eyes. She&rsquo;s got no idea
        what to connect it with.</p>
    <p>&lsquo;Brilliant!&rsquo; Olka laughed and added Weronika must take better care of herself, after which she took
        out a rustling 50-zloty note and handed it to Wu, who&rsquo;d just come back from the toilet, asking him to buy
        another round.</p>

    <div class="text-separator"></div>

    <p>A tram number 9 derailed in the district of Wilda, hitting cars.</p>
    <p>Meanwhile, in a completely different part of the city, along the PST (Poznań Fast Tram) line, on tracks laid down
        in a deep long trench, which &mdash; full of snow &mdash; formed a completely white tunnel, a two-cabin tram
        number 16 hurtled along like a bullet. Inside people were crowding, the cabins fishtailed at sharper turns, and
        each time it happened a sudden wave came through the passengers clinging to yellow tubes and the backs of seats,
        from the front to the back of the cabin, making them for a moment like one organism.</p>
    <p>At the very end of the second cabin, leaning against a railing and staring outside through a dirty pane, stood
        Weronika (in a red jacket) and some other woman, probably a bit younger: in a black coat, black boots, thick
        vivid orange tights, wrapped in a black scarf, onto which long straight dark brown hair was falling. Weronika
        and the girl didn&rsquo;t talk, perhaps the deafening clatter of the wheels on the rails was the reason, and
        glanced at each other only now and then, for the most part, however, staring absent-mindedly at tracks flashing
        outside the window. The view behind the panes made up the following sequence: the whiteness of snow, the
        greyness of concrete (Słowiańska Street Station), the whiteness of snow, the greyness of concrete (Solidarność
        Avenue Station), and then the whiteness of snow again.</p>
    <p>An oblong barrack of a shopping centre loomed over the tunnel, its elevation illuminated with glaring lights,
        with a luminous yellow cord undulating along the building, and from the perspective of the rushing tram this
        edifice could resemble a dignified, slowly swimming whale. When the vehicle reached the next, this time
        stunningly colourful, station (Lechicka/Poznań Plaza), Weronika told Zuza (that is how she addressed the girl
        staring through the window) to wake up, they needed to get off, and then they both headed for the exit.</p>
    <div class="text-separator"></div>
    <p>No more than two hours later another tram number 16 arrived at a stop in Małe Garbary Street, the automatic door
        opened, and people started to step out of the green cabins. Among them were Weronika and Zuza, carrying heavy
        linen bags, inside of which bottles of wine clanked.</p>
    <p>&lsquo;Oh give me a break&rsquo;. Weronika turned her head away. Zuza touched her shoulder in a conciliatory
        gesture and said she was just worried about her, that&rsquo;s all.</p>
    <p>Yeah, yeah, everyone&rsquo;s worried about Weronika, but at the same time they treat her as if she were
        twelve.</p>
    <p>&lsquo;Because you behave like you&rsquo;re twelve&rsquo;. Zuza laughed, and Weronika quickly joined her in
        laughter.</p>
    <p>Zuza added that, all right, she&rsquo;d stop wittering about Jerzy, &rsquo;cause it didn&rsquo;t make much sense
        anyway and Weronika was going to do what she always did, after which she cursed the never-ending frost and
        suggested that they go here, to the green, leave their bags on the bench and smoke, &rsquo;cause another few
        minutes without a cig and she&rsquo;d go nuts.</p>
    <p>Weronika, heading with Zuza towards the green, uttered a long sigh. She gets it, she knows that what she&rsquo;s
        doing is totally dumb and nothing good&rsquo;s going to come of it, but there&rsquo;s something about Jerzy that
        she can&rsquo;t free herself of; anyhow, maybe they should change the topic, and a smoke is a great idea. They
        left their bags on a dilapidated bench, Zuza took out a pack of cigarettes, offered one to her friend, they
        started to smoke, there was a row of cars standing in the street, a tram crossing the intersection, while the
        snow around them covered a layer of dead grass, animal faeces, litter, broken glass. The cigarette smoke was
        milky from the frost.</p>
    <p>Zuza asked whether Weronika&rsquo;d seen the coverage from the attack scene. You have to admit it was a
        spectacular job, the damage was really massive, and it&rsquo;ll take years to patch up the rifts in the city
        infrastructure.</p>
    <p>She paused mid-sentence, as she saw someone: along the untended path crossing the green walked a fairly tall
        blond man in an olive jacket with a white cap pulled over his ears. On seeing the girls, he gave a wide grin and
        walked over to them.</p>
    <p>They talked for a while, the man decided to have a smoke as well, Weronika and Zuza called him Kuba, Kuba asked
        whether they were going to Mięsna that night, to which they replied they were preparing a small party at Wu&rsquo;s,
        but Kuba should drop by since he&rsquo;d be in the neighbourhood anyway. There&rsquo;ll only be a few of them,
        there&rsquo;ll be squid and the ratio of bottles of wine to participants looks very promising. Kuba replied he&rsquo;d
        think about it, &rsquo;cause he was working on some &lsquo;friend&rsquo;, as he called her, but he can equally
        well work on her at Wu&rsquo;s, after which he said he must be going, &rsquo;cause it was his tram, but he&rsquo;d
        let them know.</p>
    <p>The girls finished off their cigarettes, put them out against the edge of the bench, lifted the heavy bags full
        of wine, bread, vegetables, cephalopods, headed towards a zebra crossing and &mdash; after waiting several
        minutes at a red light &mdash; kept going along Estkowski Street to carefully walk down an ice-covered
        escarpment to a place where the Warta River once flowed but now it was a sports field and a row of parking
        spaces, cross this field, walk among cars parked in the snow, go past a row of tin garages (black-and-white
        graffiti on the walls) and walk further, towards Chwaliszewo Street.</p>

    <div class="text-separator"></div>

    <p>The kitchen walls were covered with ragged dark pink wallpaper; on the squalid kitchen cabinets, on the kitchen
        worktop, on the fridge stood flowerpots spewing out tangled shoots of ivy. Once you entered the kitchen, you had
        the impression it&rsquo;s a freeze-frame from a film and one careless move would be enough for the whole room to
        be consumed, in a split second, by the vividly green vegetation.</p>
    <p>Weronika and Zuza sat at the table, covered with plastic cloth and crammed with bottles of wine, a bowl full of
        (deep-fried) squid in beer batter, a plate of lemons, an ashtray. Wu, on the other hand, stood opposite them,
        leaning against the kitchen worktop and tapping his leg along to music coming from a laptop placed on top of the
        fridge. The three of them all drank red wine from glasses; once in a while cigarette ends lighted up above the
        table. Weronika said she&rsquo;d dreamt about small glowing pink rectangles, the same as during that drunken
        night. She laughed, said she must have taken some shit while under the influence, or that chap, whoever he was,
        slipped a date rape drug into her cocktail, as Kuba generously suggested. Speaking of Kuba, where is he? They
        should call him to come by. Wu sighed and already started chastening Weronika, saying she needed to take care of
        herself, &rsquo;cause she was really going over the top this time and it couldn&rsquo;t fucking end well, when a
        loud ring of the doorbell interrupted him.</p>
    <p>Wu disappeared into the entrance hall, a cold draught from the staircase entered the kitchen, one could hear
        &mdash; in spite of the blaring music &mdash; increasingly louder steps on the stairs, and, after a moment, Olka
        entered, uttering a cheerful &lsquo;hi there!&rsquo; (She was followed by Wu carrying an armful of new bottles
        of wine.) Olka forced her way through the grey smoke to kiss Weronika and Zuza, declared she&rsquo;d come only
        for a minute, &rsquo;cause she needed to go to sleep at a reasonable hour, but she&rsquo;d love to taste the
        legendary squid. Then she took a cigarette in her hand and began to look for a lighter. Weronika lifted a
        burning match in front of Olka&rsquo;s face, saying Kuba was supposed to be here as well, but he&rsquo;s working
        on some chick, so no one knows if he&rsquo;s going to come.</p>
    <p>Yeah, Olka knows, she saw them yesterday in Dragon. She reached into the bowl for a piece of squid flesh coated
        in breadcrumbs, devoured it in one go and continued saying this chick was a tough one. For the whole evening
        Kuba pretended to be interested in pharmacy, as she was some pharmacy student, whispered in her ear that he&rsquo;d
        love to see her in a lab coat and protective eyewear, he almost started naming his favourite medications, when
        the girl interrupted him mid-sentence, saying it&rsquo;d been very nice, but she must be home by midnight. She
        even tricked him into paying for the cab.</p>
    <p>Wu, flipping through songs on the computer, said Kuba never liked the easy way. To Zuza&rsquo;s remark,
        expressing her irritation with the constant change of music, he reacted with unchanging composure, saying he was
        looking for a piece he&rsquo;d listened to while wasted the night before. He totally can&rsquo;t remember which
        one it was. Or maybe he&rsquo;s imagining things.</p>
    <p>Finally he resigned, played a random track, leant against the wall and said those terrorist are batshit crazy.
        Watching their speech sent shivers down his spine. On the other hand, they shouldn&rsquo;t be surprised: the
        authorities have treated them like cattle for centuries, and when you look at this now, it&rsquo;s hard to
        believe we were so naïve. This was bound to happen eventually. Though there must have been a lot of bluff in all
        this; it&rsquo;s impossible they have the technology they were talking about.</p>
    <p>Could Weronika, please, relax with a glass of wine on her day off, without being forced to hearing about those
        fuckers all the time? (For a while she&rsquo;d been squatting on a chair upholstered in leatherette, with a
        glass in her hand and rolling her eyes at times.)</p>
    <p>&lsquo;You&rsquo;re lucky you&rsquo;ve got a day off&rsquo;, retorted Zuza, who &mdash; as she quickly added
        &mdash; hadn&rsquo;t had a day off in three weeks, because her greed made her take on another translation,
        though her schedule was already full, and to top this all off Weronika has been dragging her round the shops and
        tricked her into cooking some bloody squid, just as if she knew how to cook.</p>
    <p>&lsquo;Oh, have a drink&rsquo;. Weronika laughed, filling up Zuza&rsquo;s glass.</p>
    <div class="text-separator"></div>
    <p>The events of the rest of this evening could be captured in stills: Wu leaning against the fridge, Zuza, Weronika
        and Olka at the table, bright dots of burning tobacco. Next, a similar scene, but with Kuba and a dainty
        bright-haired girl standing in the doorway, the girl was pale and had big blue eyes, she barely spoke a word.
        Then the dark pink kitchen, Weronika and Zuza above an empty bowl, the former complaining about her complicated
        relationship with Jerzy, a cloud of grey smoke above their heads. Half an hour later at the table sat Weronika,
        Zuza and Kuba, Kuba had just seen his blonde friend to a cab and told the girls someone must have got pretty
        stoned, &rsquo;cause they&rsquo;d broken into the military museum and stolen a war scythe. Even later, a similar
        scene: Wu standing in the doorway with a bottle of wine saying Olka had gone to Dragon after all, but promised
        she&rsquo;d be back, which meant she wouldn&rsquo;t. Then a bulb blowing out, darkness instantly filling the
        kitchen. Later again the rest of them sitting by candlelight, against the background of the wallpaper, which
        seemed almost black in this lighting, Weronika immersed in a greenish glow beaming from the phone and texting.
        After one more hour there was only Wu, Kuba and Zuza, the latter saying it always ends like this, sooner or
        later Jerzy calls and after ten minutes Weronika&rsquo;s gone. And the last scene: a candle burning out, Wu and
        Kuba sitting in silence above the last of the wine, with lustreless eyes, smoking; the room was tightly filled
        with smoke, the smoke was as dense as fog.</p>
    <div class="text-separator"></div>
    <p>A heavy dark sky hung above the city, it was night, Poznań&rsquo;s blocks of flats and tenement houses remained
        dormant, lampposts cast a lurid light, snow lay heavy on the roofs, while a strong, piercing wind ran along the
        network of the streets; it carried frost.</p>
    <p>In the light from the street you could see unfocused outlines of the furniture and cartons, crumpled bedding, Wu
        tossing and turning, you could smell the pungent scent of tobacco smoke, hear muffled voices of brawling chavs.
        Finally Wu sighed, got up from the bed, walked through the darkness of the entrance hall to the darkness of the
        kitchen, then groped for the switch, pushed it, and when in spite of this it was still dark, he silently cursed
        the blown out bulb. He felt around the worktop to find a bottle of mineral water and started to drink it &mdash;
        with fast, greedy gulps.</p>
    <p>Twenty minutes later he was already walking along Garbary Street, there was no one within the range of his sight,
        some dead-drunk girl lay in one of the doorways, but he couldn&rsquo;t possibly see it, so he walked, trembling
        with cold, towards Bernardine Square, passed a shop selling telescopes (a bloated Jupiter in the poster next to
        the entrance), a row of black shop windows, a chemist&rsquo;s &lsquo;Wenus&rsquo;.</p>
    <p>Then he followed the tramline towards the river, Mostowa Street at this time of day was dark and motionless, no
        cars were approaching, so Wu walked diagonally to the other side and kept striding along the street, only to
        take a right turn before Roch Bridge and go down a steep embankment to the very edge of the river. The Warta
        River was ice-bound and covered with a thick layer of snow, the sky whitish from the glow of the city, Wu smoked
        and walked slowly along the invisible bank, and while walking, he sometimes squinted his eyes and massaged his
        eyelids with his fingers, like one does to soothe an unbearable headache.</p>
    <p>One time when he opened his eyes, and it was when he had nearly reached Chrobry Bridge, he suddenly stopped to
        stare for a moment, straining his eyes, into the dark space under the bridge&rsquo;s deck. Right next to the
        bank, under a pillar loomed some shape. Wu hesitated, then took a few steps forward, approaching the shape to a
        distance at which one could already see it was a girl kneeling in an unnatural pose, strangely bent forwards. He
        asked if everything was all right. Silence. After a moment he came even nearer, an arm&rsquo;s length away, and
        &mdash; with hesitation &mdash; gently touched her shoulder, but the girl didn&rsquo;t budge. Finally he took a
        phone from his pocket and shone it on her face.</p>
    <p>The reddish light revealed a mouth gagged with a decent-sized lemon, blue, ghastly open eyes, hands tied behind
        the back and a belly slit open to pour a ripe cluster of guts onto the snow.</p>
