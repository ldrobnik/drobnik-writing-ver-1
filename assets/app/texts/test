<p id="first">A tram number 9 derailed in the district of Wilda, hitting cars.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in a completely different part of the city, along the PST (Poznań Fast Tram) line, on tracks laid down in a deep long trench, which &mdash; full of snow &mdash; formed a completely white tunnel, a two-cabin tram number 16 hurtled along like a bullet. Inside people were crowding, the cabins fishtailed at sharper turns, and each time it happened a sudden wave came through the passengers clinging to yellow tubes and the backs of seats, from the front to the back of the cabin, making them for a moment like one organism.</p>
<p>At the very end of the second cabin, leaning against a railing and staring outside through a dirty pane, stood Weronika (in a red jacket) and some other woman, probably a bit younger: in a black coat, black boots, thick vivid orange tights, wrapped in a black scarf, onto which long straight dark brown hair was falling. Weronika and the girl didn&rsquo;t talk, perhaps the deafening clatter of the wheels on the rails was the reason, and glanced at each other only now and then, for the most part, however, staring absent-mindedly at tracks flashing outside the window. The view behind the panes made up the following sequence: the whiteness of snow, the greyness of concrete (Słowiańska Street Station), the whiteness of snow, the greyness of concrete (Solidarność Avenue Station), and then the whiteness of snow again.</p>
<p>An oblong barrack of a shopping centre loomed over the tunnel, its elevation illuminated with glaring lights, with a luminous yellow cord undulating along the building, and from the perspective of the rushing tram this edifice could resemble a dignified, slowly swimming whale. When the vehicle reached the next, this time stunningly colourful, station (Lechicka/Poznań Plaza), Weronika told Zuza (that is how she addressed the girl staring through the window) to wake up at last, they needed to get off, and then they both headed for the exit.</p>
<div class="text-separator"></div>
<p>No more than two hours later another tram number 16 arrived at a stop in Małe Garbary Street, the automatic door opened, and people started to step out of the green cabins. Among them were Weronika and Zuza, carrying heavy linen bags, inside of which bottles of wine clanked.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh give me a break&rsquo;. Weronika turned her head away. Zuza touched her shoulder in a conciliatory gesture and said she was just worried about her, that&rsquo;s all.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, everyone&rsquo;s worried about Weronika, but at the same time they treat her as if she were twelve.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Because you behave like you&rsquo;re twelve&rsquo;. Zuza laughed, and Weronika quickly joined her in laughter.</p>
<p>Zuza added that, all right, she&rsquo;d stop wittering about Jerzy, &rsquo;cause it didn&rsquo;t make much sense anyway and Weronika was going to do what she always did, after which she cursed the never-ending frost and suggested that they go here, to the green, leave their bags on the bench and smoke, &rsquo;cause another few minutes without a cig and she&rsquo;d go nuts.</p>
<p>Weronika, heading with Zuza towards the green, uttered a long sigh. She gets it, she knows that what she&rsquo;s doing is totally dumb and nothing good&rsquo;s going to come of it, but there&rsquo;s something about Jerzy that she can&rsquo;t free herself of; anyhow, maybe they should change the topic, and a smoke is a great idea. They left their bags on a dilapidated bench, Zuza took out a pack of cigarettes, offered one to her friend, they started to smoke, there was a row of cars standing in the street, a tram crossing the intersection, while the snow around them covered a layer of dead grass, animal faeces, litter, broken glass. The cigarette smoke was milky from the frost.</p>
<p>Zuza asked whether Weronika&rsquo;d seen the coverage from the attack scene. You have to admit it was a spectacular job, the damage was really massive, and it&rsquo;ll take years to patch up the rifts in the city infrastructure.</p>
<p>She paused mid-sentence, as she saw someone: along the untended path crossing the green walked a fairly tall blond man in an olive jacket with a white cap pulled over his ears. On seeing the girls, he gave a wide grin and walked over to them.</p>
<p>They talked for a while, the man decided to have a smoke as well, Weronika and Zuza called him Kuba, Kuba asked whether they were going to Mięsna that night, to which they replied they were preparing a small party at Wu&rsquo;s, but Kuba should drop by since he&rsquo;d be in the neighbourhood anyway. There&rsquo;ll only be a few of them, there&rsquo;ll be squid and the ratio of bottles of wine to participants looks very promising. Kuba replied he&rsquo;d think about it, &rsquo;cause he was working on some &lsquo;friend&rsquo;, as he called her, but he can equally well work on her at Wu&rsquo;s, after which he said he must be going, &rsquo;cause it was his tram, but he&rsquo;d let them know.</p>
<p>The girls finished off their cigarettes, put them out against the edge of the bench, lifted the heavy bags full of wine, bread, vegetables, cephalopods, headed towards a zebra crossing and &mdash; after waiting several minutes at a red light &mdash; kept going along Estkowski Street to carefully walk down an ice-covered escarpment to a place where the Warta River once flowed but now it was a sports field and a row of parking spaces, cross this field, walk among cars parked in the snow, go past a row of tin garages (black-and-white graffiti on the walls) and walk further, towards Chwaliszewo Street.</p>

<div class="text-separator"></div>

<p>The kitchen walls were covered with ragged dark pink wallpaper; on the squalid kitchen cabinets, on the kitchen worktop, on the fridge stood flowerpots spewing out tangled shoots of ivy. Once you entered the kitchen, you had the impression it&rsquo;s a freeze-frame from a film and one careless move would be enough for the whole room to be consumed, in a split second, by the vividly green vegetation.</p>
<p>Weronika and Zuza sat at the table, covered with plastic cloth and crammed with bottles of wine, a bowl full of (deep-fried) squid in beer batter, a plate of lemons, an ashtray. Wu, on the other hand, stood opposite them, leaning against the kitchen worktop and tapping his leg along to music coming from a laptop placed on top of the fridge. The three of them all drank red wine from glasses; once in a while cigarette ends lighted up above the table. Weronika said she&rsquo;d dreamt about small glowing pink rectangles, the same as during that drunken night. She laughed, said she must have taken some shit while under the influence, or that chap, whoever he was, slipped a date rape drug into her cocktail, as Kuba generously suggested. Speaking of Kuba, where is he? They should call him to come by. Wu sighed and already started chastening Weronika, saying she needed to take care of herself, &rsquo;cause she was really going over the top this time and it couldn&rsquo;t fucking end well, when a loud ring of the doorbell interrupted him.</p>
<p>Wu disappeared into the entrance hall, a cold draught from the staircase entered the kitchen, one could hear &mdash; in spite of the blaring music &mdash; increasingly louder steps on the stairs, and, after a moment, Olka entered, uttering a cheerful &lsquo;hi there!&rsquo; (She was followed by Wu carrying an armful of new bottles of wine.) Olka forced her way through the grey smoke to kiss Weronika and Zuza, declared she&rsquo;d come only for a minute, &rsquo;cause she needed to go to sleep at a reasonable hour, but she&rsquo;d love to taste the legendary squid. Then she took a cigarette in her hand and began to look for a lighter. Weronika lifted a burning match in front of Olka&rsquo;s face, saying Kuba was supposed to be here as well, but he&rsquo;s working on some chick, so no one knows if he&rsquo;s going to come.</p>
<p>Yeah, Olka knows, she saw them yesterday in Dragon. She reached into the bowl for a piece of squid flesh coated in breadcrumbs, devoured it in one go and continued saying this chick was a tough one. For the whole evening Kuba pretended to be interested in pharmacy, as she was some pharmacy student, whispered in her ear that he&rsquo;d love to see her in a lab coat and protective eyewear, he almost started naming his favourite medications, when the girl interrupted him mid-sentence, saying it&rsquo;d been very nice, but she must be home by midnight. She even tricked him into paying for the cab.</p>
<p>Wu, flipping through songs on the computer, said Kuba never liked the easy way. To Zuza&rsquo;s remark, expressing her irritation with the constant change of music, he reacted with unchanging composure, saying he was looking for a piece he&rsquo;d listened to while wasted the night before. He totally can&rsquo;t remember which one it was. Or maybe he&rsquo;s imagining things.</p>
<p>Finally he resigned, played a random track, leant against the wall and said those terrorist are batshit crazy. Watching their speech sent shivers down his spine. On the other hand, they shouldn&rsquo;t be surprised: the authorities have treated them like cattle for centuries, and when you look at this now, it&rsquo;s hard to believe we were so naïve. This was bound to happen eventually. Though there must have been a lot of bluff in all this; it&rsquo;s impossible they have the technology they were talking about.</p>
<p>Could Weronika, please, relax with a glass of wine on her day off, without being forced to hearing about those fuckers all the time? (For a while she&rsquo;d been squatting on a chair upholstered in leatherette, with a glass in her hand and rolling her eyes at times.)</p>
<p>&lsquo;You&rsquo;re lucky you&rsquo;ve got a day off&rsquo;, retorted Zuza, who &mdash; as she quickly added &mdash; hadn&rsquo;t had a day off in three weeks, because her greed made her take on another translation, though her schedule was already full, and to top this all off Weronika has been dragging her round the shops and tricked her into cooking some bloody squid, just as if she knew how to cook.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, have a drink&rsquo;. Weronika laughed, filling up Zuza&rsquo;s glass.</p>
<div class="text-separator"></div>
<p>The events of the rest of this evening could be captured in stills: Wu leaning against the fridge, Zuza, Weronika and Olka at the table, bright dots of burning tobacco. Next, a similar scene, but with Kuba and a dainty bright-haired girl standing in the doorway, the girl was pale and had big blue eyes, she barely spoke a word. Then the dark pink kitchen, Weronika and Zuza above an empty bowl, the former complaining about her complicated relationship with Jerzy, a cloud of grey smoke above their heads. Half an hour later at the table sat Weronika, Zuza and Kuba, Kuba had just seen his blonde friend to a cab and told the girls someone must have got pretty stoned, &rsquo;cause they&rsquo;d broken into the military museum and stolen a war scythe. Even later, a similar scene: Wu standing in the doorway with a bottle of wine saying Olka had gone to Dragon after all, but promised she&rsquo;d be back, which meant she wouldn&rsquo;t. Then a bulb blowing out, darkness instantly filling the kitchen. Later again the rest of them sitting by candlelight, against the background of the wallpaper, which seemed almost black in this lighting, Weronika immersed in a greenish glow beaming from the phone and texting. After one more hour there was only Wu, Kuba and Zuza, the latter saying it always ends like this, sooner or later Jerzy calls and after ten minutes Weronika&rsquo;s gone. And the last scene: a candle burning out, Wu and Kuba sitting in silence above the last of the wine, with lustreless eyes, smoking; the room was tightly filled with smoke, the smoke was dense as fog.</p>

<p>XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</p>

<p id="first">A heavy dark sky hung above the city, it was night, Poznań&rsquo;s blocks of flats and tenement houses remained dormant, lampposts cast a lurid light, snow lay heavy on the roofs, while a strong, piercing wind ran along the network of the streets; it carried frost.</p>
<p>In the light from the street you could see unfocused outlines of the furniture and cartons, crumpled bedding, Wu tossing and turning, you could smell the pungent scent of tobacco smoke, hear muffled voices of brawling chavs. Finally Wu sighed, got up from the bed, walked through the darkness of the entrance hall to the darkness of the kitchen, then groped for the switch, pushed it, and when in spite of this it was still dark, he silently cursed the blown out bulb. He felt around the worktop to find a bottle of mineral water and started to drink it &mdash; with fast, greedy gulps.</p>
<p>Twenty minutes later he was already walking along Garbary Street, there was no one within the range of his sight, some dead-drunk girl lay in one of the doorways, but he couldn&rsquo;t possibly see it, so he walked, trembling with cold, towards Bernardine Square, passed a shop selling telescopes (a bloated Jupiter in the poster next to the entrance), a row of black shop windows, a chemist&rsquo;s &lsquo;Wenus&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Then he followed the tramline towards the river, Mostowa Street at this time of day was dark and motionless, no cars were approaching, so Wu walked diagonally to the other side and kept striding along the street, only to take a right turn before Roch Bridge and go down a steep embankment to the very edge of the river. The Warta River was ice-bound and covered with a thick layer of snow, the sky whitish from the glow of the city, Wu smoked and walked slowly along the invisible bank, and while walking, he sometimes squinted his eyes and massaged his eyelids with his fingers, like one does to soothe an unbearable headache.</p>
<p>One time when he opened his eyes, and it was when he had nearly reached Chrobry Bridge, he suddenly stopped to stare for a moment, straining his eyes, into the dark space under the bridge&rsquo;s deck. Right next to the bank, under a pillar loomed some shape. Wu hesitated, then took a few steps forward, approaching the shape to a distance at which one could already see it was a girl kneeling in an unnatural pose, strangely bent forwards. He asked if everything was all right. Silence. After a moment he came even nearer, an arm&rsquo;s length away, and &mdash; with hesitation &mdash; gently touched her shoulder, but the girl didn&rsquo;t budge. Finally he took a phone from his pocket and shone it on her face.</p>
<p>The reddish light revealed a mouth gagged with a decent-sized lemon, blue, ghastly open eyes, hands tied behind the back and a belly slit open to pour a ripe cluster of guts onto the snow.</p>
<div class="text-separator"></div>
<p>Meanwhile, a little more than three kilometres to the north, along Murawa Street, between the cuboid blocks of flats of Wuthering Heights Estate on one side and of Cosmonauts Estate on the other, Weronika walked with a shaky gait, smoking a cigarette, crying, uttering silent curses and at times wiping her tears with the back of her trembling hand. When she was approaching Solidarność Roundabout, the almost absolute silence of the city was suddenly interrupted by a phone ringing. She tossed one more &lsquo;fuck&rsquo;, hurled a butt-end into the snow (it cut across the air like a comet roaring with fire) and started to nervously poke around her pockets. Finally she took out the mobile phone and once she saw who was calling, her face, now drenched in a green glow, filled with anxiety.</p>
<p>She picked up. Whoever was calling, she told him: calm down, one thing at a time, slowly, from the beginning, listened in silence to a voice coming from the receiver, growing paler by the second, until she finally crouched and hid her face in her palm. She muttered they must stay calm, she&rsquo;d be right there, everything would be fine. The voice in the receiver said something, she asked if he was really going to be okay, &rsquo;cause she could take a cab any minute, although he might be right, it probably doesn&rsquo;t make much sense, let him just call her when they stop questioning him. She stayed silent for a moment, taking heavy breaths, the voice in the receiver also grew silent, until she finally asked, &lsquo;What about Kuba? Does he know?&rsquo;</p>

<div class="text-separator"></div>

<p id="first">The main area of the pub Dragon was filled with the smell of incense, cigarette smoke hanging above the tables, sad music coming from the speakers, people crowding densely along the bar, in front of whom and behind the bartenders&rsquo; backs one could see a row of long shelves filled with bottles of liquor. Over the scene loomed a carved dragon head, protruding from the wall and painted black.</p>
<p>The pub itself was an enormous, multi-level creation: beneath the main area there was a stifling basement with another bar and a cramped dance floor; from the main room one could also go outside to the garden &mdash; this time of year claustrophobic and covered with snow. From the garden, via a narrow stairway, you could reach higher levels: another bar behind a swing door, through which you could go to a second garden on a high terrace snuggled against a weather-beaten wall; to a room opposite this bar; to another room above it &mdash; and yet another, fitted on a wooden mezzanine above the bar. From one of these rooms you could get &mdash; through a usually closed door &mdash; to subsequent spaces: a room housing concerts and author meetings, and from there &mdash; to yet another bar. Dragon was like a slow-spreading cancer each year occupying new spaces of the old tenement house, appropriating new rooms and corridors, and no one seemed to have any doubt that one day it would engulf it all.</p>
<p>In the corner of the main room, next to a door leading to the garden, in the soft light of a shaded floor lamp, Zuza and Wu reclined on a sofa, accompanied by a stooped Kuba sitting on a comfy pouf. On the table stood three barely touched beer mugs; in the middle, a vase with white tulips. The three of them remained silent almost all the time, smoking unhurriedly and looking somewhere ahead.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Can&rsquo;t believe it&rsquo;, murmured Kuba and leant down to wet his lips with the beer. He just can&rsquo;t get his head around it. Okay, he saw Ania a second time in his life and had no serious plans for her, but such things, fuck, just should not happen. Though maybe that&rsquo;s the reason he feels so shitty about it. And the way they killed her. Like in some slaughterhouse.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t torture yourself&rsquo;. Wu touched his shoulder for a moment. &lsquo;What could you do?&rsquo;</p>
<p>He knows, he knows. After all, he saw her off to that cab, paid for the fare. He even started to suspect she was seeing him only because of those cab rides.  &rsquo;Cause there was no way he could talk her into sleeping with him. He saw her drive away, so how is it possible that she found herself back by the river? One hundred metres from Wu&rsquo;s place?</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m going to fucking implode&rsquo;, interrupted Weronika, who had just come from behind the bar to sit on Wu&rsquo;s lap and, having leaned towards the table, take a cigarette of out a pack and ask if anyone had a lighter.</p>
<p>It must be some punishment that she works behind a bar when she almost viscerally hates people. She should have consulted a career advisor or something. But wait, she can&rsquo;t do anything else anyway.</p>
<p>&lsquo;How&rsquo;re you doing?&rsquo; she asked, tenderly ruffling Kuba&rsquo;s blond mop of hair, once she stopped laughing at her own joke.</p>
<p>&lsquo;As you can see&rsquo;, he grunted, clenching his fists in turn (his joints softly crackled). Zuza, who remained silent for this whole time, looked at his wrists covered in bright down. And all those interrogations, he&rsquo;s going there again tomorrow. How much can you take?</p>
<p>They fell silent and got back to listless smoking and drinking. People crowded in queues outside the bathroom and at the bar, some visibly inebriated man in his twenties staggered towards Kuba, almost spilling his drink on him, while the speakers now played a jauntier, electronic piece.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Break&rsquo;s over&rsquo;, Weronika finally announced with resignation, put out the cigarette, kissed Wu&rsquo;s temple and got back behind the bar.</p>
<p>Wu followed her with his eyes and happened upon a pair of small black eyes piercing him. A short black-haired man of slight build, pale face and prominent lips, the one who paid Wu a night-time visit two days earlier, was sitting on a bar stool in front of a small beer. He stared at Wu for a moment with a timid smile, finished his beer, and once he had drained it, he stood up from the bar and started forcing his way through the clump of people, towards the exit.</p>


<p >XXXXXXXXXXXXXX</p>

<p id="first">She said she remembered the navy-blue sky over Międzymoście Square, there were white clouds below the sky, gulls against the background of the clouds, and she was walking with that dude, whatever his name was, she must have got herself wasted really badly. They walked like that between one guarded car park and another, now she almost recalls his face, he might have had thick black eyebrows, protruding cheekbones, he was saying something, they were talking, they might have said something about Venus, about Ceres. Next Chwaliszewo Street, Czartoria Street, the broken lamppost kept flickering while they were necking in front of the off-licence. She remembers she felt the texture of a navy-blue jacket under her fingers; the frost seemed to pierce her with small daggers. They kept walking, perhaps towards the river, she&rsquo;s just remembered he helped her down the ice-covered embankment, she guesses there were some other people, can&rsquo;t remember how many, her lips were chapping, she totally can&rsquo;t recall their faces. They stood for some time under the bridge, the motionless ice-bound white river, they were talking, she was completely drunk, it was night, trams no longer ran, until one moment the bloke who&rsquo;d led her there took out a box from his pocket, and a small object out of it &mdash; a rectangle giving off pink, fluorescent light. And then nothing, a complete blank.</p>
<p>Olka laughed. No soap opera is better than Weronika&rsquo;s stories about her drunken excesses, and she just can&rsquo;t wait for new episodes, because each one is a whole new level of absurdity. Weronika whined it wasn&rsquo;t funny, she&rsquo;d got totally blotto, she couldn&rsquo;t have drunk that much, that guy must have slipped something into her cocktail, and what&rsquo;s with those rectangles, maybe she was hallucinating or dreamed the whole thing, but in the last few days, whenever she closes her eyes, she sees small pink bloody rectangles, it&rsquo;s driving her nuts, and on top of it there&rsquo;s that girl under the bridge. She stopped, hid her face in her palms and let out a theatrical sigh. Olka laid her hand on Weronika&rsquo;s forearm and told her to calm down, nothing really happened, she just needed to take a better care of herself, said she&rsquo;d been through a lot, this whole situation with Jerzy and all, said it was going to be okay, she simply needed to work some things out, after which she downed a shot of vodka with one swift move.</p>
<p>They were sitting in Mięsna. Snow was melting on the dirty floor, they were set against a wallpaper with a concentric orange and purple pattern, a lamp with a plastic shade, the interior was dense with cigarette smoke, loud with music, crowded with people, bartenders behind the counter poured beer into plastic mugs, as they&rsquo;d apparently run out of glasses. From the main room you could go upstairs, where there was a dance floor surrounded by different wallpaper with a pattern in shades of purple and orange and full of passive bodies of tipsy twenty-year-olds bending to the music. You could also, through a currently closed door, go down to the basement with a small stage. If places had memory, the yellowish walls of this room could still feel the touch of bodies swarming in a darkroom, which was located in here just a few years earlier.</p>
<p>&lsquo;By the way&rsquo;, said Olka, &lsquo;tell me how things between you and Jerzy are. Is there any chance it&rsquo;s going to work out this time?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Weronika glanced at a bearded DJ behind turntables, at drunken people in their twenties swarming around the bar and replied to her ever more inebriated friend that she didn&rsquo;t really know. Please, let Olka not mention it to Zuza or Wu, but they&rsquo;ve already managed to have two deadly quarrels. That night when Ania got killed they fought so badly she walked home all the way from Winogrady to the centre. But we&rsquo;ll see.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And that thing with Zuza and this guy&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>Jacek? It didn&rsquo;t work out. They went on a few dates, and then Zuza retreated. Olka gave an understanding nod only to ask, as if struck by a sudden thought, &lsquo;Has Zuza ever been in a serious relationship at all?&rsquo;</p>
<p>On hearing this question, Weronika stammered, looked to both sides in reflection, then again at Olka, who suddenly burst into laughter.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, well. And I thought you were such besties&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Come on, Olka&rsquo;s fully aware what Zuza&rsquo;s like; it&rsquo;s hard to get her out of her shell. And she&rsquo;s such a good listener. (Olka couldn&rsquo;t stop laughing.) Weronika remained silent for a while, let out a nervous chuckle and finally asked whether she&rsquo;s really such an egocentric person.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t worry. Zuza doesn&rsquo;t seem to be bothered&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Weronika, somewhat embarrassed, took a big gulp of beer, after which she changed the subject, saying she was worried about Wu, he&rsquo;d been working too much lately, sitting at his laptop from early morning until late night and banging on the keys, and the last thing he needed was a story with a corpse under the bridge.</p>
<p>Olka eyed Weronika in silence for a moment, as if a little concerned, against the background of the bar, the lights, the clouds of smoke, turning over a lighter in her hand, until she finally asked, or rather stated, &lsquo;You&rsquo;re not over it yet, are you?&rsquo;</p>

<div class="text-separator"></div>

<p>After Mięsna it was time for Dragon, for pushing one&rsquo;s way through the crowd, drinking vodka at the bar, smoking cigarettes, for superficial conversations with friends and freshly befriended people, for drunken looks at blurred lights. In just twenty minutes, the completely intoxicated Olka managed to knock two beers from the bar with her elbow, put out a butt-end in someone&rsquo;s cocktail and insult her fiftyish-looking friend by asking her how she was coping with her old age.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Weronika, also drunker by the minute, sat on the small wooden stairs at the door to the garden and watched people, silently sipping cherry vodka on ice (freezing air wafted through the crack under the door). After a while she started poking around her pockets to eventually reach for her jacket lying on the side and take out the phone; immersed in a greenish glow and slurping alcohol through a straw, she began to type a text message.</p>
<p>Suddenly she raised her eyes and saw a man in front of her, who had been standing there motionless for at least a minute: not too tall, of a rather slight build, with a few-day-old stubble and prominent lips. He asked if he could join her and, without waiting for Weronika&rsquo;s reply, sat next to her on the wooden step.</p>
<p>Said his name was Staszek and he&rsquo;d been in town since very recently and didn&rsquo;t know too many people, asked whether Weronika came here often and, having received no response, began to blab about his musical interests. Weronika kept typing. Her strained face and blank stare suggested it caused her considerable difficulty. She kept sipping cherry vodka through a straw and seemed to completely ignore Staszek, who said he&rsquo;d never really liked Tori Amos&rsquo;s music, but got hold of her double record from the late nineties, which he found somewhat interesting, especially the arrangements, and the lyrics, which &mdash; as always in the case of this artist &mdash; were definitely noteworthy. As Weronika remained unimpressed with Staszek&rsquo;s digressions about popular music (the smell of his cologne lingered in the air), he clearly decided to show his wide reading and started to talk about his interest in classic science fiction. He proudly told her that after much hardship he&rsquo;d got his hands on the anthology <i>Farewell Fantastic Venus</i>, the first edition from 1968 (when he talked, his protruding Adam&rsquo;s able moved and his muscles shifted under his T-shirt), until all of a sudden he asked Weronika&rsquo;s name.</p>
<p>She stopped pressing on the keys and looked at Staszek for the first time. After a moment of silence she introduced herself, remarked it was a pleasure, only to take the last sip of her cocktail, put the glass down on the step, get up and, having grabbed her jacket, start forcing her way towards the exit.</p>
<p>She told Staszek, who was following her, that no, he didn&rsquo;t have to see her home, and no, she wouldn&rsquo;t give him her number, and they&rsquo;d surely come across each other many times, &rsquo;cause in this shitty city there are maybe four decent pubs, after which she opened the door to the street and walked out into the burning frost.</p>

<div class="text-separator"></div>

<p>Above the ice-bound river hung a dark, equally still sky, it was the middle of the night, the lights of Poznań were slowly going out, from a bird&rsquo;s-eye view one could see the individual districts: Rataje, Sołacz, Łazarz, Winogrady, plunge deeper and deeper into impenetrable darkness. The only visible thing left now was a network of streets lit with the pale glow of lampposts.</p>
<p>In the shade of Chrobry Bridge, right above the frozen Warta, you could see a moving bright point. If you looked at it with human eyes, which gradually adjust to darkness, you could see an ever sharper outline of a silhouette, a shaking hand, a visibly anxious face. The luminous point glowed for the last time, and Wu tossed the butt-end towards the river. Then, using his mobile phone as a torch, he started raking up snow in the place where a few nights earlier he had found the slit-open corpse of a woman.</p>
<p>After several minutes of clearly futile search, he put his phone back into his pocket and took a few steps towards a pillar of the bridge, when a silent crack sounded under his shoe. He crouched, took out the phone again, shone it under his feet and dug out a small black object from the whiteness. He swept snow from its smooth, slightly fractured surface and then it became clear it was an mp3 player (it shone vaguely in the nocturnal light).</p>
<p>Without hesitation, he took a pair of tangled earphones out of his pocket, plugged them into the player, placed them in his ears and pushed a big black button. On the dark surface flashed the text &lsquo;track 05&rsquo;, and a moment later Wu&rsquo;s eardrums were hit by a clear and powerful, seemingly multiplied sound of French horns which played an unhurried, melancholic, insistently repeated phrase. A dozen seconds passed, and the text disappeared, the music fell silent.</p>

<div class="text-separator"></div>

<p>Small glowing pink rectangles, I can see them whenever I close my eyes, the navy-blue sky over Międzymoście Square, the white clouds below the sky, the grey gulls, guarded car parks, frost like small daggers plunged into the body, once again we walk towards the river, neck in front of the off-licence, the scratching of his stubble, once again the pink rectangles, something about Venus, about Ceres, Chwaliszewo Street, the lamppost like a strobe light, Czartoria Street, walking down the ice-covered embankment,</p>
<p>now sitting in my kitchen, everything&rsquo;s still grey, the snow-covered St Adalbert Street outside the window, the blurred outlines of the kitchen furniture and fridge getting sharper by the minute, the light from the laptop that must make me look like a ghost, strange sobriety, the last of the last beer, my hands still trembling, I look at the curtain edges, then close my eyes, the small pink bloody rectangles, the words of our quarrel still resounding in my head like a broken record, insults shouted by Jerzy, the sound of a shattered glass, the rustle of clothes packed in a hurry, my own, weirdly alien voice, screaming that if I feel like it, I&rsquo;ll let half of the city shag me, and it&rsquo;s none of his business, because it&rsquo;s over, a door slum,</p>
<p>the pink rectangles, in my mind I walk out again heated into the cold night, stand in front of the block of flats, Cosmonauts Estate is silent and unreal, my hand struggles to hold a cigarette when I try to light it, the smoke irritates my throat, sore from all the screaming, the light of the lampposts, the blue door of the block of flats, its wall painted in blue rectangles, blue gutters and the equally blue bench and fence enclosing a white lawn, I need to keep it together, naked branches casting tangled shadows on the snow, I start to sob and, a few minutes later, walk across the roundabout, empty at that hour, under the night sky heavy with white clouds, wondering what Zuza and Wu are going to say, I can almost see their concerned but smug faces, they always know better, and I always get myself into the same sick situations,</p>
<p>stop thinking about it, St Adalbert Street outside the window, almost no beer left, there&rsquo;s still a little wine in the fridge, lurid light, drinking straight from the bottle, the pinkness of rectangles under my eyelids, thinking about Wu, suddenly it&rsquo;s the first weeks of our friendship, it&rsquo;s early summer and we go together to the Warta River, to the sun-burnt grasses, to be devoured by mosquitoes, we sit down on the concrete river bank, still warm from the scorching day, looking at the river&rsquo;s waters, listening to the hum of cars on Chrobry Bridge, drinking <i>krupnik </i>straight from the bottle and talking, it turns out we read the same books, go to the same films, have confusingly similar reflections on the emptiness and pointlessness of life, something about Venus, about Ceres, it&rsquo;s getting colder, Wu wraps his arm around me, goose pimples all over my body, suddenly my breathing gets faster and I feel a desire to take him home, for eternal exclusivity, and make love to him all night until dawn, because I don&rsquo;t know yet that in a week&rsquo;s time he&rsquo;ll introduce me to his boyfriend,</p>
<p>the small pink rectangles, pink blood gushing from arteries, I dive again into the coolness of the deserted Winogrady Street, feeling agitated after my quarrel with Jerzy, walk along the row of villas and the park lurking behind them, on top of the sparkling, well-trodden snow, I can&rsquo;t stop thinking about the terrorists&rsquo; new announcement, Antarctic landscapes and threats spoken by a speech synthesizer, the beating of my heart, on both sides of the street are dark windows, people sleeping behind them, likely dreaming about their relationships, children and problems at work, the pink rectangles under my eyelids, and I have the ever more palpable presentiment that all this might suddenly vanish: those villas, that dark park, tramlines, all the bus stops, streets and blocks of flats, all the shops, and I, who walk crying in the middle of the freezing night,</p>
<p>thinking what it is that makes me come back to Jerzy over and over, push my way repeatedly into his no longer young arms, I&rsquo;m starting to regret I told him about that guy, with whom I went to the river and who must have slipped something into my drink, about that kiss under the lamppost, about the ice-covered embankment, about the small pink rectangle, okay, perhaps we were trying to get together with Jerzy at that time, but weren&rsquo;t a couple yet, I didn&rsquo;t think he could be jealous of such a thing, though Jerzy can be jealous of anything really,</p>
<p>almost no wine left, the kitchen almost completely bright, the walls bright pink once again and I&rsquo;m standing once more in front Dawid, the first of the series of arseholes Wu fell for, at first I don&rsquo;t feel a thing, I have the impression I am lifted high above Poznań, they stay down below, Wu touting questionable attributes of the slightly chubby blond in a way too tight T-shirt, and I keep looking at all this without emotion from the height of hundreds of metres, my sight can embrace all the districts, Winogrady, Grunwald, Wilda, Rataje, finally I come back down to the ground, talk to them for a few minutes and, on my way home, buy a half-litre bottle of <i>żołądkowa </i>and two cartons of grapefruit juice to drink disgustingly warm cocktails and cry long into the night.</p>


<p>XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</p>

<p id="first">Blood vessels were dilating, pulmonary alveoli evenly filled with air and then emptied, I was running along a tramline, the sky was still clear, while running, I could see the Merchant of Poznań department store, there were people, I could hear keys and coins jingling in my pocket.</p>
<p>I was in a hurry to get home, the city, I thought, had been much nicer since they&rsquo;d built the new tramline, I wanted to get home before Kazik left, because he was about to leave, there were white clouds in the sky, the sky was blue, there was even some sun, Kazik was about to go to another city for a while.</p>
<p>The Chopin Park, the pink church, I was running along the tracks, the sky was clear, in places I could see black, perfectly symmetrical cubes, at different heights, yet still much higher than tenement roofs, I thought, I remember, that it was an ad campaign for a new mobile phone company, now I laugh at this thought, that all over the city there appeared black levitating cubes, which aroused dismay, surprise, anxiety or whatever other feeling they were meant to arouse, and after two weeks it was going to become clear it was all just meant to make you buy a new phone, from a new company, with a new camera and an mp3 player.</p>
<p>I wanted to make it to see Kazik, but first I had to give Mirka back a book I&rsquo;d borrowed from her, before she left as well, white clouds, squares against the background of white clouds, they seemed so two-dimensional from the ground, they were cubes though, before she left, because Mirka was about to leave as well, soon, I had no idea if I was going to see her again or if she was really going to leave, because there&rsquo;d been a few times when she&rsquo;d been supposed to leave but eventually hadn&rsquo;t, I thought there was fog, even though the air was clear and the sky was blue.</p>
<p>There was no fog, that was just my thinking, but if there&rsquo;d been any, it would have tightly covered all the buildings: tenement houses, shops, and one couldn&rsquo;t see a thing, and I would have just been running in that whiteness, and that whiteness would have been cold.</p>
<p>I was 15 minutes late, it could be worse, Mirka had been waiting for me somewhere in Garbary Street, I don&rsquo;t know why we&rsquo;d arranged to meet there exactly, maybe she liked to watch the wig shop, or perhaps there was some more important reason, as I was running, I could see the cubes at times, I was much more interested, however, in what was in front of me and what was under my feet so that I wouldn&rsquo;t trip over the bloody uneven paving.</p>
<p>I saw Mirka from a distance, she was kind enough not to look ostentatiously at her watch, the tenement roofs were above us, there was the sky, the cubes in the sky, and I ran up to her, panting, and my eyes said I&rsquo;m sorry, but she just smiled and kissed me on the cheek, commenting on my stubble I hadn&rsquo;t had the time to shave, and we went somewhere, don&rsquo;t remember where.</p>
<p>I remember it was some shitty café and that on its walls there were some awkwardly painted figures of actors, I&rsquo;m starting to recall what café it was, from time to time Mirka ran her fingers through her bright hair, she was wearing it loose, while usually she wore it tied up, and her eyes that day were somewhat sad.</p>
<p>I gave her the book, and she said she wasn&rsquo;t going to leave yet, said she&rsquo;d stay a little longer in this fucking city, in this fucking country, and I thought that at that very moment the fog filled the whole café, and everyone was enveloped in it, and the waitress was groping her way around, or maybe she had a special fog suit and fog lights, Mirka kept running her fingers through her hair.</p>
<p>I said I was in a hurry, said I wanted to make it before Kazik left, so I could stay only for an hour or so, I had already forgotten when his train was leaving.</p>
<p>Mirka kept talking through that fog, though there was no fog, and I listened to her but at the same time thought about 8-bit games, such as <i>Boulder Dash</i>, I loved to play those 8-bit games on 8-bit computers when I was a kid and spent hours in my yellow room upstairs and used a screwdriver to adjust the head in the tape drive, and on the screen there appeared sprites that were 24 pixels wide and 21 pixels high.</p>
<p>Mirka was sad, I wasn&rsquo;t surprised she felt that way, and though I really didn&rsquo;t want her to leave, I knew she would be better off somewhere else, after all that had happened to her, because a couple of years earlier Mirka had suffered a coma and then her boyfriend, Przemek, had vanished somewhere, but instead of talking about those sad things that still sat somewhere in her head, she talked about Björk&rsquo;s new album, that she really liked the song <i>Wanderlust</i>, I liked it as well and told her how I liked those horns, trumpets and whatever brass also played there, and the beat I suspected was a beat from an early nineties drum machine, and at the same time I thought about the cubes, I&rsquo;d even dreamt about them, but then I still thought it was all an ad campaign.</p>
<p>In those dreams the cubes were growing, they were like the amoeba from <i>Boulder Dash</i>, because in <i>Boulder Dash</i> there was an amoeba that kept growing and growing and was composed of many square, pulsating elements, and in those dreams the cubes were growing just &lsquo;Better tell me how your novel&rsquo;s going&rsquo;like that amoeba, but in 3D, and new cubes kept appearing side by side, over and over again, although at that time all the cubes in the sky were still single.</p>
<p>And I didn&rsquo;t believe it could be any other way, because for me they were still an ad campaign, just like when those big red hands had appeared all over the city, Mirka had thin wrists and pale palms, she was playing with a napkin, or maybe a beer mat, and said she&rsquo;d found a new job and maybe wouldn&rsquo;t leave this time, that is, it was nothing for certain, just an offer, I thought about fog that entered the ears, entered the mouth and permeated every canal inside the body.</p>
<p>And I thought about nucleotides that, quite probably, at that moment formed pairs in many different parts of my body and, quite probably, various mutations occurred, and every such mutation could lead to malignant neoplasm, and all I could do was count on each cell&rsquo;s defence mechanism, I told Mirka it had been weird between me and Kazik lately, that we hadn&rsquo;t been having sex at all, because he&rsquo;d been working all the time, and I&rsquo;d been staying at home so unemployed and playing on a Commodore 64 emulator and sending CVs and checking my email to see if anyone&rsquo;d replied.</p>
<p>Mirka told me to wait, to take it easy, to remember Kazik was a little reserved and that the whole situation probably blew his mind a little, though he wouldn&rsquo;t let anyone notice, and told me everything would be just fine and then started talking about some new shoes she&rsquo;d spotted in a window but couldn&rsquo;t afford.</p>
<p>And then she said something about <i>Naked Lunch</i>, I&rsquo;d read that book, but when I read it, my mind kept drifting away, because it was when I suspected Kazik was having an affair, even though he probably wasn&rsquo;t, only neurotransmitters inside my brain, as usual, failed to work the way they should, so I don&rsquo;t remember much from the book, later on Mirka said something about a guy she&rsquo;d met, but after all she&rsquo;d been through, she somehow wasn&rsquo;t that keen on being with anyone or maybe she just couldn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>The book I gave her back was <i>Axing </i>by Stachura, actually I&rsquo;d read only small fragments of it, because lately, somehow, I hadn&rsquo;t had the patience to read books, there were many brilliant fragments in that book, including one about fog.</p>
<p>We sat there for a while, and then I had to go, I paid the bill, even though Mirka insisted on paying, and we walked out, said goodbye, I embraced her tightly, we arranged to meet another day, I was happy she wasn&rsquo;t leaving yet.</p>
<p><i>Let your body go with the flow</i>, I hummed inside my head, rushing to catch a tram.</p>

<div class="text-separator"></div>

<p>Got off the tram, crossed the street, right in front of me there was Under the Lime Trees Estate, the housing estate I lived in, blue blocks of flats of Cosmonauts Estate loomed to the left, and behind my back, also to the left, stretched Wuthering Height Estate, full of cuboid blocks of flats that looked like they&rsquo;d been taken from late Malevich&rsquo;s paintings, the sky was less blue and more cloudy, but black cubes against a white background invariably hung under it, the lowest almost touching the tower block roofs, there were many cubes but at that time all single and separated by large distances.</p>
<p>I walked along a four-floor block, there were trees, there was a parking lot, and I thought about Mirka, why she&rsquo;d decided to stay, because she&rsquo;d really wanted to leave, and I guessed it wasn&rsquo;t just the job offer she&rsquo;d got, there must have been something else that kept her in the city, but in my head most thoughts were on whether Kazik had already left or not yet and whether I would make it to say goodbye and how long he was going to be out of town and how I hated sleeping alone.</p>
<p>While entering my block of flats, I remembered Mirka&rsquo;s story about some absurd emails she&rsquo;d kept receiving, saying she&rsquo;d been chosen and had some mission to accomplish, eventually she&rsquo;d stopped receiving them, at least hadn&rsquo;t mentioned them for a while, and then I thought that maybe she&rsquo;d made them all up, because it was such a strange story, and I was afraid that maybe she was slowly losing it, maybe it was all because of that coma, after all she&rsquo;d been through I&rsquo;d probably have gone crazy myself, especially as that prick Przemek had left her and vanished into the blue, fled somewhere, even his parents couldn&rsquo;t reach him, or maybe something bad had happened to him, I couldn&rsquo;t even remember the last time I&rsquo;d met him, anyway, it probably wasn&rsquo;t of any importance, I guess I kept thinking about all that just because I didn&rsquo;t want to think whether Kazik was still home or not, because my ground floor flat was only a couple of steps ahead, and I was somewhat nervous.</p>
<p>The door was locked with both locks, a bad sign, I opened it, and the flat was indeed already empty, Kazik had left, oh well, I got upset, closed the door and went to the bathroom because after that beer my bladder was a bit full, and as I was standing over the bowl, I noticed that Kazik&rsquo;s toothbrush was missing from the cup on the basin.</p>
<p>Of course it was missing, because in other cities people also need to brush their teeth, but then I got scared and thought that maybe he&rsquo;d left me, then I was mad at my brain and all the chemicals that governed it, at the fact that I panicked so easily whatever happened, even if nothing happened.</p>
<p>Later I went to the kitchen to make something to eat, opened the cupboard, and there were only my mugs, only my plates and my pots were in the other cupboard, I went to the big room, and Kazik&rsquo;s clothes weren&rsquo;t in the wardrobe, Kazik&rsquo;s books and records weren&rsquo;t on the shelf, Kazik&rsquo;s papers weren&rsquo;t in the small room, where our desk stood.</p>
<p>I remember that at that moment I thought about black cubes suspended in a white space, cubes which multiplied by two, that is, next to them, wall against wall, there appeared new cubes, creating aggregates of two, three, even four, until they formed something in the shape of a three-dimensional amoeba from <i>Boulder Dash</i>, engulfing more and more of the white space.</p>
<p>But at that time all the cubes in the sky were still single, and there was no sign they were going to multiply, and I sat down on my bed, completely at a loss, and felt adrenaline released into the blood stream, a sudden lack of serotonin and dopamine in my brain and of all the other drugs one needs not to break down.</p>
<p>I sat like that for a long time, and I guess it started getting dark, and I remained completely motionless, and my mind was blank, and I guess I wasn&rsquo;t thinking anything, although for quite a while I&rsquo;d been aware of a piece of paper lying on the table but didn&rsquo;t have the strength to stand up or maybe was just afraid to stand up and read it.</p>
<p>The piece of paper said, I got to know that when I&rsquo;d finally found the courage to stand up and walk to the table, that Kazik hoped I wouldn&rsquo;t hold a grudge, that he had to leave and that he loved me, that he hoped we&rsquo;d still manage to find each other, but for the time being it wasn&rsquo;t an option, and that I shouldn&rsquo;t wait for him, that he had a very important mission very many things depended on, more important than anything else at that moment, and that I shouldn&rsquo;t try to contact him.</p>
<p>Trying to contact him was the first thing I did, but he didn&rsquo;t pick up, then I tried once more but from a private number, so that he wouldn&rsquo;t know who was calling, but he didn&rsquo;t pick up anyway.</p>
<p>It was already dark when I gave in, my mind was blank, or maybe I just don&rsquo;t recall now what I was thinking about, in a state of total confusion I went to the bathroom and poured some really hot water into the tub.</p>
<p>Immersed myself in it, unwilling to think of anything for a while, blood vessels were dilating, and my head, making nothing of my willing, was still full of thoughts about Kazik, about why he had left, and where he could have gone, I thought I had to call each one of his friends and then thought about the day I was reading <i>Naked Lunch</i> and was somewhere halfway through, and Kazik said he had to go to the radio and would be back in a couple of hours, it was afternoon, it was about two years earlier, I couldn&rsquo;t focus on the book so decided to go out and kept wandering around the city for a long time, reached the city centre, reached The Old Brewery, a shopping centre in Półwiejska Street, and with headphones over my ears, the song was called <i>Hajnal</i>, I kept walking through its hallways, looking at shop windows.</p>
<p>And then I saw him, Kazik was sitting at a table, eating some ciabatta or other rubbish, and in a chair on the opposite side of the table there was a man, young, probably not too tall, he had dark hair and little eyes, he was eating something as well, they talked, I never told Kazik I&rsquo;d seen them there.</p>
<p>Once I got out of the tub, I grabbed the phone and stood in front of the window, it was already almost completely dark, a Społem shop, a primary school, a tower block, yet in the sky you could still see black cubes against an almost black background, my legs were shivering.</p>
<p>I called each one of Kazik&rsquo;s friends whose number I knew, there weren&rsquo;t many, I called also those from the radio and learnt Kazik hadn&rsquo;t shown up for a month, others said they hadn&rsquo;t heard from him for two weeks or so, they were probably lying, he was probably hiding at someone&rsquo;s place, Kazik&rsquo;s parents were dead, I ran out of ideas.</p>
<p>So I lay down on the bed, and it was dark, and I lay in the darkness, my wallpaper was also covered in small black squares, I knew I wouldn&rsquo;t fall asleep that night, felt a tightness in my chest, could barely breathe, it couldn&rsquo;t have been very late, I kept tossing and turning.</p>

<div class="text-separator"></div>

<p>Somehow I managed to fall asleep after all, woke up early in the morning, a chill woke me because I hadn&rsquo;t covered myself with the quilt, I could see the black geometrical pattern of the wallpaper, I thought I needed to see Mirka, but it was too early to text her.</p>
<p>Started thinking about Kazik, maybe he was in some kind of trouble, &rsquo;cause he wouldn&rsquo;t have gone like that, maybe he&rsquo;d fallen foul of the mafia and had to leave the city or contracted HIV while drunk in some darkroom, and that was why, for my own good, he hadn&rsquo;t wanted to have sex and now had to go abroad to earn money for the expensive treatment.</p>
<p>But in my head there was still a picture of him and that man in The Old Brewery, eating ciabatta or some other rubbish.</p>
<p>I washed, ate something, took my mp3 player and went out, and while walking along blocks of flats, I imagined I was the hero of the game <i>Montezuma&rsquo;s Revenge</i> and completed one level after another, levels were coloured from purple to orange to green to red to black to pink, but the city was completely grey, in the sky there were grey clouds, grey blocks of flats and grey streets beneath them, there were black cubes in this sky, I looked carefully, in places there were two or three cubes adjoined side to side, then I remembered that dream and remembered <i>Boulder Dash</i>, and a chill ran down my spine.</p>
<p>Most of the cubes, however, were still single at that time, I quickly changed songs on my player, but none matched my mood, until I finally happened upon <i>How to Disappear Completely, </i>and let it play, because I also wanted to completely vanish and I listened to it completely again and again, the blocks of flats ended, family houses began, some construction site, some car showroom, and then the tramway tracks took a turn, because I was following tracks, and then I walked along Winogrady Street, glancing around the sky, but at that moment the cubes didn&rsquo;t bother me as much as Kazik did.</p>
<p>While crossing Army Poznań Street, enough with the whining, time for <i>Army of Me</i>, I finally remembered the last time I&rsquo;d seen Przemek.</p>
<p>It was right after Mirka&rsquo;s collapse into the coma, the first weeks of that horrible half-year, I went to the block of flats in Wuthering Height Estate where Przemek lived, because he&rsquo;d called me first, and I was anxious to meet him, wanted to stop thinking about Mirka and all of that and had no pleasure in witnessing the extent of his despair, because he must have been in despair, at least that was what I thought, I remember being inside a lift going up to the tenth floor, it reeked inside the lift, and no sooner had I walked into Przemek&rsquo;s flat than he said we must go down to the garage.</p>
<p>He was strangely excited, wearing an orange shirt, red hair peeked out of an unbuttoned collar, it was winter, and he didn&rsquo;t even put a jacket on, we took a lift down, barely spoke a word, went to the garages, it was snowing, Przemek opened the door and turned on the light.</p>
<p>In the middle of the garage stood a strange vehicle, a bathyscaphe of sorts, its side was open, I could see billowing cables and strange mechanical parts, I was completely at a loss for what to say, while he, full of excitement, talked about his plan to rescue Mirka, said the vehicle was equipped with a grenade launcher, a circular saw on a boom, six protracting telescopic arms that helped you move when there was some occlusion.</p>
<p>Completely at a loss for what to say, I stood there in silence, thinking maybe I should call his parents, I would have if only I&rsquo;d had their number, later on, after he&rsquo;d disappeared, I told myself he was a total fucker to have left Mirka like that, but all that time I&rsquo;d had a feeling that something wrong had happened to him.</p>
<p>The bathyscaphe disappeared from the garage as suddenly as did Przemek, at least his parents said no word about it.</p>
<p>I reached the city centre, went under a railway flyover, there was a fast tram flyover nearby, it was getting cold, it started to drizzle, again I listened to <i>How to Disappear Completely </i>and again thought only about Kazik, and the pavement was wet, and water was gathering in the gutter.</p>
<p>Turned off the player, the beating down of the increasingly heavy rain, decided to call Kazik, but it went to voicemail, left no message, buildings, trees, getting closer and closer to a noisy crossroads.</p>
<p>I forgot to mention that since the beginning of this story I had smoked almost a whole packet of cigarettes and while getting closer to the noisy crossroads, I lit another one, the rain tried to put it out, but it was smouldering soundly, nicotine thoroughly permeated the structure of my lungs, gradually released into the bloodstream, I spent the whole day aimlessly wandering around the city, managed to eat something at a milk bar, I also forgot to mention that Kazik, next to the piece of paper, left two thousand zloty, so that I wouldn&rsquo;t starve and could buy some cigs and alcohol, because he knew that without him I would smoke and drink big time, I managed to text Mirka to meet up, wasn&rsquo;t late this time, the place of our meeting was the tram stop by the Collegium Maius building.</p>
<p>As I mentioned, this time I wasn&rsquo;t late, she embraced me tightly, and while walking towards the round Okrąglak building, we barely said a word, went inside some café with a large picture window, and could be seen drinking some espressos or lattes, or whatever we drank there, and we could see people passing by.</p>
<p>First we didn&rsquo;t talk about Kazik, only about some general stuff, about that job Mirka was probably going to get, she was supposed to meet and talk details on the following day, and then, finally, we started speaking about Kazik, I told her everything, asked if he hadn&rsquo;t called, she said she was probably the last person he would have called, they weren&rsquo;t very fond of each other, she also said that maybe he had panicked, maybe he would come back after a while.</p>
<p>We were silent for some time, drinking that coffee, we could be seen, and the people on the street were visible to us as well, tramways, Okrąglak, Gwarna Street, later she told me she thought someone was following her, that she&rsquo;d gone to a book store in the Old Market Square the day before to buy Pasewicz&rsquo;s poems, and some guy was following her, then she was walking down Półwiejska Street, he was walking down the street as well, when she went to her place in Lower Wilda Street, he watched her enter the building.</p>
<p>I asked her what he&rsquo;d looked like, a short guy, she replied, but hooded, so she hadn&rsquo;t seen clearly, then she decided it might have had something to do with those emails she&rsquo;d received for a while, I didn&rsquo;t know what to think of that.</p>
<p>We were silent for a while, then I decided we had to get drunk, I had to at least, and she could keep me company, she kept me company on the way to a pub, and while walking, we watched the sky, in which there were fewer and fewer single cubes and increasingly more black angular solids comprising two, three, four and even more cubes, we looked at them with anxiety, but didn&rsquo;t say a word.</p>
<p>Going home inside a night bus, I was looking at trees.</p>

<div class="text-separator"></div>

<p>I had a dream the room I was sleeping in was being filled with water, I smoked some cigarettes in the morning, washed, didn&rsquo;t feel like eating, sat in front of the computer and kept sitting there for a long time, looking at numerous uninteresting websites, I even logged into my email account I hadn&rsquo;t used for ages.</p>
<p>The spam folder was full of messages, I thought the mailbox should delete them by itself, but it hadn&rsquo;t, and since I had nothing better to do, I opened the folder and started browsing through, got to spam that was two years old, and between emails regarding penis enlargement and various financial lotteries I found one entitled <i>You have been chosen</i>:</p>
<p><i>The times of Ragnarök are coming to your city, </i>read the strange email<i>, you are one of its guardians, you have a mission, you have to find the remaining five and coordinate their own missions, so when Ragnarök comes, they will build a new city in place of the old one, among the guardians is a woman who will bring the city to its doom, you have to find her first to postpone Ragnarök until you find the remaining guardians, soon you will receive further instructions.</i></p>
<p>What a bunch of bollocks, I thought, but then remembered the emails Mirka talked about and felt uneasy, who could it be who had sent them, I decided to question Mirka about all this, it must have been someone we knew, someone was poking fun at us.</p>
<p>I took the mp3 player, went outside, wind was blowing, it was drizzling, clouds were billowing, but right underneath the clouds hung formations composed of cubes, I couldn&rsquo;t count them, but there were already groups of ten and more, they hung above the blocks of flats, cast shadows, their clear edges stood out against the grey clouds, rain flowed down the smooth surfaces, I had the impression they were growing by the minute, and new cubes emerged, but I couldn&rsquo;t say for sure, because I never knew on which solid I should keep an eye.</p>
<p>There might have been dozens of such solids above the housing estate alone, I could barely see single cubes, grey rain was falling, and there were grey clouds.</p>
<p>I checked the time, it was already past ten, soaking up the rain, I dialled Mirka&rsquo;s number, it went to voicemail, tried again after a while, I had the Społem shop in front of me, voicemail again, more and more black shapes in the sky, maybe the black cubes really were forming a black amoeba taken from <i>Boulder Dash</i>, maybe, I thought, it would engulf more and more of the urban space.</p>
<p>Then it was time for the city, tramways, rain, aimless wandering, listening to music, I kept looking up at the sky, where the angular black shapes were bigger and bigger and composed of more and more cubes and they took away more and more light, so it seemed as though storm clouds were coming, I dialled Mirka&rsquo;s number again and again and each time it only went to voicemail, I dialled Kazik&rsquo;s number, voicemail again.</p>
<p>I had the keys to Mirka&rsquo;s flat and thought maybe I would go there, because I felt something bad had happened, though I was sure that it was just too much of some and too little of some other chemicals in the synapses of my brain, that in fact nothing had happened, there was rain, I kept thinking about Kazik, and it seemed as if I hadn&rsquo;t seen him for a long, long time.</p>
<p>I remembered, as if through a fog, that we had watched some match, I hated matches, and right before the winning goal the screen had gone out and a fragment of some Japanese cartoon appeared, a landscape of blocks of flats, a woman in a long dress, she was hanging high up in the air with the dress touching the ground, her hair, even longer than the dress, was branched in a stellar fashion, waving like in Japanese cartoons, the woman had bright hair, her eyes were closed, cracks formed in the ground, light poured from the cracks, large chunks of the ground went in the air, buildings were turning to rubble, then the match switched back on.</p>
<p>The city, the city centre, Mirka&rsquo;s block of flats not far ahead, I was hungry but decided to eat something later, thought about Kazik, listened to <i>Pluto</i>, the next thing I knew I was standing in front of the entrance.</p>
<p>While opening her flat&rsquo;s door, after I had rung and rung, and no one had answered, I felt shivers running down my spine, the flat was empty, all her things were in their right places, evenly sorted out as they usually were at Mirka&rsquo;s, I could see blocks of flats through a window, went inside the room, a neatly made bed, net curtains, I went through papers piled on the desk, Mirka&rsquo;s CV, a cover letter to some company, the company&rsquo;s name was First Star Translations, there was no address, in the air there was this strange type of silence when you know that in a moment it will be that silent no longer.</p>
<p>Behind my back the bathroom door burst open, someone ran out, I turned back, the entrance door was open wide, I slammed it closed while running out, a hooded guy in the corridor, he was running really fast, too many cigarettes, I won&rsquo;t reach him, I shouted at him, he ran even faster, then I chased him along the street, over both our heads there were black solids made of cubes and there were clouds, some Peaches song would make a perfect soundtrack to this chase, paving stones flashed beneath our feet, blood vessels were dilating, some special drugs started to release into the bloodstream, I had a body that felt no tiredness and eyes that could see in the dark, though it was light at that moment, but the one running before me, that hooded guy, didn&rsquo;t grow weaker either and didn&rsquo;t slow down, he ran a red light, I followed him, we found ourselves in front of The Old Brewery, I wondered how we&rsquo;d managed to get there so quickly, I was closer and closer, caught him by the hood, he turned back and broke free right away and vanished somewhere in the crowd, but I managed to see his face.</p>
<p>It was that man with little eyes and dark hair I had seen with Kazik, two years earlier, while they were talking and eating some rubbish.</p>
<p>Over Półwiejska Street, along its edges, right above the tenement houses, stretched a huge cloud composed of cubes, the cloud kept growing, I was short of breath.</p>


<p>XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</p>

<p id="first">One was orange, one purple, and one pink.</p>
<p>Stauromedusae, I looked up their name in Wikipedia, clung to the windowsill, attached to it with their stalks, they had translucent little bodies shining in the bluish light from the window, goblet-shaped, upside-down umbrellas with deep notches, spherical groups of tentacles at the edges, when I touched their springy bodies, they instantly shrunk.</p>
<p><i>Yesterday was dramatic, today is OK</i>, I hummed inside my head, I was in the study, surrounded by orange wallpaper covered in white vertical stripes, and between the stripes there swam finely painted siphonophores and jellyfish, the carpeting was dark orange, the furniture black, I was sitting opposite the window, in front of a black desk, a laptop on top of the desk, the small stauromedusae were still on the windowsill, I thought I should eat some breakfast before getting down to work, I couldn&rsquo;t even remember the topic of the article I was supposed to write.</p>
<p>I went to the kitchen, the kitchen was right next to the study, lined with red wallpaper in small black diamonds, black cabinets were hanging opposite the door, under the cabinets there was a worktop, a sink, a cooker, I took a loaf of whole grain bread out of the breadbox, one needs to stay healthy, and cut off two slices, placed a shred of lettuce on top of each, some cottage cheese, a few small shrimps, sprinkled it all with olive oil.</p>
<p>A cup of tea, as always green, you need to rinse out toxins deposited in the guts, I sat at the black table in the corner next to the study door and looked at the window, the pane was cloudy as usual, two vertical fluorescent tubes were lit behind it, what can Staszek be doing at the moment, where can he be, after a second, I thought about something else.</p>
<p>Only crumbs were left on the plate, down to the sink with the plate, then up on the drying rack, the study door was behind me, I heard my laptop&rsquo;s fan working, it would be good to get down to writing, but maybe a bath first.</p>
<p>From the kitchen I walked to the bedroom, a large beige interior, beige wallpaper in light orange stripes and a pattern on top of them, portholes of a bathyscaphe, a bed in the opposite corner, I hated this wallpaper, cold light of windows, a sound system, floor speakers, a wardrobe full of clothes behind the corner, I remembered when, drenched in tears, I had gone to sleep in my flat in the Rataje district and woken up in this bedroom, I remembered it had been cold, everything as if behind a layer of mist, from the bedroom I had walked to the library, from the library to the entrance hall, next to the study, the kitchen and back to the bedroom, it didn&rsquo;t frighten me then, I finally felt safe, and while standing like that in the bedroom and reminiscing, I realised it had been almost two years since I&rsquo;d started living in this red house.</p>
<p>I walked into the bathroom, the bathroom was adjacent to the kitchen, I should get down to the article, but first a bath, on pink tiles, in places, white cephalopods and jellyfish were painted, behind a cloudy window pane one could see two fluorescent tubes, I poured some water, some sea salt, the water foamed at the edges of the tub.</p>
<p>After the bath I got back to the bedroom, checked if there was anything in the mail cabinet, my favourite piece of furniture, which, through a system of pipes, collected mail that was addressed to me, a carton of cigarettes came, super-lights of course, from the bedroom I went to the library.</p>
<p>The library was L-shaped and inside it there were four black shelves, full of books and high up to the ceiling, there were windows, there was wallpaper in red horizontal stripes, and between the stripes red algae and eels, I walked through the library, at its end there was an entrance to the storeroom, took out a packet of cigarettes and put the remaining ones on a shelf in the storeroom, through the entrance hall painted in white and pink horizontal stripes I came back to the study.</p>
<p>While writing the article, I listened to various songs, at times I walked out into the staircase for a cigarette, it was the best place to have a cigarette as the smoke was sucked up the staircase as if through a chimney, soft orange carpeting, some composite of its smell made me calm, beige wallpaper with seaweed and cuttlefish, winding stairs, its handrail wrapped in orange Christmas lights, a painting on the wall, a red pentagon on a white background, I managed to finish the article by five.</p>
<p>It was time for dinner, I made myself some pasta with spinach and pine nuts, after dinner it was time for a cigarette, I went out into the staircase, once again the soft carpeting, once again the lights, I got lost in thought, the cigarette burnt my mouth, it was time to put it out.</p>
<p>I went down the winding stairs, sometimes I liked to stroll around the other floors, on the floor below, in the staircase, there was an identical room with orange carpeting, behind the door was an identical entrance hall in pink stripes, but without my shoes and coats, from the hall I went to an L-shaped library, empty bookshelves, went to an unoccupied beige bedroom, and then through an empty kitchen and an empty study back to the entrance hall.</p>
<p>Since I&rsquo;d woken up those two years ago in my bedroom, I had wondered how many identical floors there were in this house, whether the floors ended at any point and whether any of them were occupied.</p>
<p>In the evening I logged into a sex chat room as wet_fanny, looked through images of webcams, my favourite one was fucker81, he was there every night, you could see him from neck to knees, he had a nice dick, that guy reminded me a little of Staszek, but was a tad stouter, fluorescent tubes behind window panes went out one after another.</p>
<p>At night I played with my pussy, thinking of him.</p>

<div class="text-separator"></div>

<p>When I still lived in Poznań, I was afraid to walk the streets at night, but in this house composed of an infinite number of identical floors it was always safe, in the evenings fluorescent tubes in windows turned off by themselves, so I could get enough sleep and work efficiently throughout the day.</p>
<p>I was working on an article about Portuguese wines, had to finish it by five, I wondered whether I was going to make it, because the text was still at a nascent stage, I remembered various excerpts of my life with Staszek, taking a dirty lift to his flat, our meetings at a café, meetings at a pub, sitting together and studying for exams, I remembered trams and buses.</p>
<p>I also thought about my first meeting with Przemek, he had lived in the same block of flats as Staszek did, only several floors below, when I saw his red hair, broad shoulders, previously unknown substances started to release into my blood, that was the impression I had, something deep inside my head made me unable to tear my eyes away from his strong wrists, taut stomach, the line of his shoulders, I wondered for a long time afterwards whether Staszek had noticed my reaction.</p>
<p>Having grown tired of work, I left the desk and sat in the armchair for a moment, I looked at myself from the opposite end of the room, in greyscale, the monochromatic me in a soft black armchair, and behind me a dark grey background in a white pattern: vertical stripes with finely painted siphonophores and jellyfish swimming between them.</p>
<p>I wanted something, didn&rsquo;t know what, but for sure it wasn&rsquo;t writing the article, I thought it might be nicotine hunger, though at that time I was still convincing myself I was not an addict, so I walked out into the staircase, the soft orange carpeting, the red pentagon on a white background, in the middle of the cigarette I realised it wasn&rsquo;t the thing I was missing.</p>
<p>So I went to the library, cold fluorescent tubes behind opaque panes, I took some book, read some sentences, put it back right away, walked to the beige bedroom, in the bedroom the air was always strangely warm, I sat in the armchair, floor speakers touching the ceiling, I pressed a button on the remote, music seeped from the speakers, <i>carry my joy on the left, carry my pain on the right, </i>were the song&rsquo;s words, I listened to it for some time and turned off the sound system, maybe I needed something else, perhaps I should get back to writing after all.</p>
<p>I walked around the bedroom a little, then around the library, finally I went out into the staircase.</p>
<p>Up the stairs, surrounded by Christmas lights entwined around the handrail, I travelled up through some four floors, each had the same carpeting, the same wallpaper, the same rooms behind the doors, though lacking all my rubbish, the wardrobes weren&rsquo;t filled with clothes, books weren&rsquo;t lying heavy on the bookshelves.</p>
<p>I often thought that maybe I should pack everything most essential into two suitcases and move to some unoccupied floor, but I always came to the conclusion it would only take me a couple of months to create a similar mess there, well, the second law of thermodynamics in action, I walked down to my floor, got back to work.</p>
<p>I sent the article with a slight delay, I was hungry, I was tired, it was time for some dinner, mussels in white wine with potato chips, the cooking magazine I worked for sent me lots of freebies, the only benefit of this work, then I surfed the Web for a long time and read about cnidarians, about different groups of cnidarians: scyphozoans, hydrozoans, cubozoans and anthozoans.</p>
<p>When I got bored, I turned on the chat room, fucker81 was, as usual, logged on, he was playing with his cock, I dared to type some words, he wrote back after a while, <i>how old are you, what do you like, describe yourself</i> and so on, then he wrote what he was going to do to me and where he was going to put it, he masturbated while doing so, I wrote I would suck him, the fluorescent tubes in the windows started turning off one after another, finally he asked if I had a cam, <i>I do</i>, I answered, he asked if I could turn it on, <i>I can</i>, I wrote, <i>but maybe not today</i>, and that I had to go but would be happy to meet tomorrow and chat about dirty things.</p>
<p>I turned off the black-and-white webcam window.</p>
<p>Then it was time for supper, I made myself some seafood salad and spent the rest of the evening in front of the computer, reading stories about cnidarians, about soft animals living in the sea, the free-floating and the sedentary ones, and about the most dangerous of all, enormous jellyfish <i>Rhizostoma pulmo</i>.</p>

<div class="text-separator"></div>

<p>In the morning I checked the mail cabinet, nothing inside, and entered the library.</p>
<p>The air was kind of weird, pinkish, it took me some time to realise the space of the library was densely intertwined with neon-like threads that emitted pink light, they were extremely fine threads of hydrozoan colonies, full of small living polyps with microscopic tentacles, the threads broke with the faintest movement and when I breathed in, they permeated deep into the lungs.</p>
<p>I thought about Staszek, about the time when nightmares woke him up in the middle of the night, and he said some incoherent things, something about doom, and then he cuddled up to me and cried for a long time, and I had no idea how to help him, I wanted to drag him to a psychologist, but he didn&rsquo;t want to go, it wasn&rsquo;t long after he&rsquo;d met Przemek on some forum.</p>
<p>I remembered when I&rsquo;d slept at Staszek&rsquo;s place, on the top floor of a tower block, through the window you could see blocks of flats in Victory Estate, a handful of windows were still lit, a panorama of the city, white clouds against a black sky, the moon, Staszek had fallen asleep before me, he was sleeping by my side, finally I fell asleep as well, dreamt of a black sea filled with jellyfish, I woke up when I heard a door slam.</p>
<p>Staszek wasn&rsquo;t there, he must have sneaked out, I went to look for him in the small room, from the small room you could also see Victory Estate and the panorama of the city, I looked inside the kitchen, a table, a loud Soviet refrigerator, I looked inside the bathroom.</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t find him anywhere, it made me worried, I thought that maybe he&rsquo;d had another nightmare, that maybe he was sleepwalking again, so I dressed up warmly, winter was coming, perhaps it was December or some other lousy month, and went out into a dark corridor.</p>
<p>Moonlight, I walked to the lifts, one of them arrived right away, I got out on the ground floor and after a while I was already in the parking lot outside the block of flats, it was freezing, naked tree branches, a tram terminus, it was not long before we broke up and I, drenched in tears, fell asleep in my flat in Rataje and woke in the house built of countless floors.</p>
<p>I reached the pavement and saw Staszek, some two hundred meters away from the block of flats, by the bus stop, he was wearing a warm red jacket, he was approaching the roundabout, I wondered whether I should call out, Castorama, street lights, no one in the street, a few last windows lit in blocks of flats, I decided to follow him.</p>
<p>He crossed through the roundabout, luckily there were no cars, he passed an off-licence and disappeared somewhere in Under the Lime Trees Estate, I didn&rsquo;t know what to think of it, I went back home, Staszek came back after an hour or so.</p>
<p>Cigarettes, writing paragraph after paragraph, something to eat, a quick bath, hours passed, and I thought about the upcoming evening more and more often, I wondered whether I wouldn&rsquo;t chicken out, whether I&rsquo;d really log into the chat room, and whether fucker81 would be there, I was writing about squid in Mediterranean cuisine, a real uphill struggle, had to finish it by five, I realised that for the whole time I had lived here I&rsquo;d only explored maybe ten floors above me and ten floors below me, and maybe those floors ended at some point, and maybe one of them was, after all, occupied, or perhaps they formed something in the shape of a loop, and if I travelled across, say, fifty or one hundred floors, I would find myself back in my flat.</p>
<p>Ah well, I couldn&rsquo;t focus, time for a cigarette, then for some music, I couldn&rsquo;t find anything that suited me, went to the library and read a couple of lines from <i>Undressing to Sleep</i>, after a minute I came back to the study, to the computer, to the squid.</p>
<p>In the evening I adjusted the position of the chair and the cam, double-checked if I could be seen only from neck to knees, and logged into the chat room.</p>
<p>Fucker81 was waiting for me, he started the talking, asked me why I was wearing clothes, I replied it could change in a second, we typed about fucking and doing different things to one another, fucker81 naked from the beginning and I, wet_fanny, more and more naked, when after some two hours we got bored, for the first time I paid attention to the background of the image from his cam.</p>
<p>Dark grey background with a white pattern: vertical stripes with finely painted siphonophores and jellyfish swimming between them, identical wallpaper to that in my place, only in greyscale, I wanted to ask about it, but fucker81 said he had to get going, sent me kisses and logged off.</p>
<p>At night, coming from the floor above, I heard some rustling, some crackling.</p>
