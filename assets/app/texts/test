<p id="first">On days like this Poznań was the cruellest of cities. It&rsquo;s hard to decide whether this was because of the twelve degrees of frost, the sharp sunlight, the motionless ice-bound white river, the snow lying on the roofs or a peculiar combination of these elements, but one could clearly sense that the city was streaked with a strange kind of anxiety, that its foundations were filled with elusive energy. You could swear it was about to suddenly break in half, and its northern and southern parts intended (just like jaws) to break away from the ground, rise towards each other with a violent movement and forcefully collide until Piątkowo&rsquo;s blocks of flats (like teeth) fitted between the tenements of Wilda.</p>

<p>If you made, right along one of its walls, a longitudinal section through the pub Kisielice, on the left side of the colourful rectangle you could see a bar, the back of a bartender working behind the bar, a wall painted in vividly coloured stripes in the background, black-and-white prints on the wall, and further towards the right end of the section: empty tables, chairs, sofas. The only clients in the pub visible from this perspective were a man and a woman, in their late twenties by the looks of it, who sat on a soft couch by the right edge of the rectangular section and talked, smoking tremendous amounts of cigarettes.</p>
<p>A cloud of grey smoke hung in the air, the woman talked about the seemingly never-ending winter, about chronic lack of sleep, she looked at a soaked poster with a deer on the window and ran her fingers through her short bright hair. When she spoke, she gesticulated wildly; while sitting, she constantly shifted; and when she was telling her companion about the preview she&rsquo;d been to in that gallery in Jeżyce district, about the stunning works she&rsquo;d seen there, she almost rose from the sofa.</p>
<p>The man, on the other hand, mostly sat in silence, inhaling smoke, listening to his friend, smiling faintly, but when he finally spoke, he covered his mouth with a hand closed into a fist or massaged his thick dark eyebrow with a thumb and stared into the distance, which made him look unsure of what he was saying.</p>
<p>While they were sitting, the pub was slowly filling up. Each time the door to the street opened, a piercing chill came in, covering in a flash the length of the stairs leading to the basement and permeating through a thick curtain which separated the pub&rsquo;s vestibule from the long colourful room. The man called the woman Weronika, while she addressed him as Wu. With the back of her hand, she stroked his few-day-old dark stubble and said it would&rsquo;ve been nice if Wu&rsquo;d moved his shapely arse again and gone to the bar for a beer. Or not, maybe she&rsquo;ll drink some wine, but only white, or better: white wine with sparkling water. And ice. Wu smiled, put out the cigarette, kissed Weronika on the forehead and rose from the table. She followed him with her eyes as he stepped deeper into the pub, and then kept looking with yearning at his almost two-metre-high body leaning against the counter, while he chatted with the bartender he apparently knew.</p>
<p>When he came back, she was sitting on the couch, snuggled into its corner, shrouded in a greenish glow beaming from her phone, texting someone obstinately. Once she noticed Wu, she took her legs off the seat and, leaning over the phone, kept pressing the buttons for a while longer. Wu asked whether it was Jerzy, and Weronika replied that yes, that she was sorry and &mdash; after some hesitation &mdash; that it seemed she and Jerzy&rsquo;d got together again.</p>
<p>In response to her friend&rsquo;s judgemental look she whined it was not that she&rsquo;d been planning it, it&rsquo;d just happened, and took the first sip. Wu sat down, wetted his lips with beer, put the glass down and tossed a rhetorical question into the dusky room.</p>
<p>&lsquo;How many times can you get into the same shit?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Look who&rsquo;s talking&rsquo;, she replied sulkily, moved closer to the armrest, as far as she could get away from Wu, whose face in turn twitched in a grimace, as if he had a retort on the tip of his tongue, but he remained silent.</p>
<p>He lit a cigarette and inhaled the smoke. Weronika kept texting for a while, until she sighed, put down the phone and suggested that maybe at least the two of them should stop arguing about it. Anyway, she bets that before two weeks have passed, in this series of break-ups and make-ups, Jerzy and she will come back to where they started. He gave a conciliatory smile, kissed her on the temple and wrapped his arm around her shoulder only to withdraw it a moment later.</p>
<p>They sat for a while, saying nothing, against the background of the wall painted in stripes of different shades of green, with black-and-white prints above their heads. Weronika smoked as well, pulled up her legs and they stayed like that almost motionless for a good few minutes, staring into the void and releasing occasional clouds of grey smoke from their lungs. Finally the thick curtain over the doorway opened, letting inside &mdash; in the company of a cold waft of air from the street &mdash; a woman of around forty.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Olka!&rsquo; On seeing her, Weronika let out a shriek, jumped to her feet and ran towards the door to throw herself into the woman&rsquo;s arms.</p>
<p>The forty-year-old found the time to say hello to her other friend at one of the tables, before she headed deeper into this colourful, half-greenish, half-reddish tunnel, which was indeed formed by the interior of Kisielice, and went to the bar. She came back to the table holding three beers, put them in front of her friends, then laughed, ran her hand through her dyed blond curls, smoked and sat on one of the chairs. She took off her warm white jacket, hung it on the back of the chair and &mdash; visibly amused for all this time &mdash; said that this thing with the attack is some deep shit, that there may be more any moment.</p>
<p>Weronika told her to let it go. She&rsquo;s fed up of discussing this topic over and over, Olka&rsquo;d better tell her what she missed in Meskal yesterday.</p>
<p>But the problem won&rsquo;t go away just because they&rsquo;ll pretend it doesn&rsquo;t exist. It&rsquo;s hard not to speak about it when such a, well, bomb hasn&rsquo;t happened in years. They thought they were living in boring times of peace, and there you have it.</p>
<p>Weronika uttered an imploring groan and said she had two days off in a row for the first time since who knows when and was really sick of hearing about that. Olka&rsquo;d better bollock her for getting back with Jerzy.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You&rsquo;ve got back with Jerzy?&rsquo; Olka let out an honest, booming laugh, which infected the others a moment later. Then she changed the topic and asked Wu about the progress of his work on those washing machine instructions for use.</p>
<p>Thankfully he&rsquo;s done with it. Now he&rsquo;s getting down to writing a truly fascinating spreadsheet user manual. Maybe he&rsquo;ll finally learn how to use a spreadsheet. He rubbed his eyebrow with his thumb again, sighed and said freelancing has surprisingly little to do with freedom. At the moment his life is reduced to typing the shit out of the keyboard. This is not what he imagined a few years ago.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, stop grumbling. You&rsquo;d prefer to work in a shop?&rsquo;</p>
<p>In response to Olka&rsquo;s words Weronika laughed and said it&rsquo;s easy to say if you&rsquo;re a director of a thriving company. Olka&rsquo;d better tell her when the last time she visited the office was.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t exaggerate. I sometimes drop by&rsquo;. Anyway, she&rsquo;s worked hard for that. If they don&rsquo;t like it, they should find a busier friend, but she&rsquo;s curious who&rsquo;s going to pay for all those drinks in that case.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And how&rsquo;s your novel going?&rsquo; she inquired.</p>
<p>Wu told her to forget it, said he hadn&rsquo;t had the time lately and, frankly, he no longer liked what he&rsquo;d written so far. It seems he&rsquo;ll have to begin again from scratch, if he only finds some free time.</p>
<p>Weronika remarked with a sneer he would&rsquo;ve had more free time, if he hadn&rsquo;t wandered from pub to pub every night, which Wu answered with a humorous &lsquo;fuck off&rsquo; only to put out the cigarette a moment later, announce he needed to take a leak, and rise from the table.</p>
<p>Once he disappeared behind the curtain, Weronika started talking about how insanely wasted she&rsquo;d got the night before, totally blotto; she didn&rsquo;t remember much: the voices of drunken people, the smell of kebabs, the bright car lights, the piercing frost. She&rsquo;d met some guy &mdash; in Dragon, or earlier, in Kisielice &mdash; and they walked somewhere together across the market square towards Garbary Street, maybe to Mięsna, &rsquo;cause where else could they&rsquo;ve gone. When she woke up, she couldn&rsquo;t remember anything else, except for the image of small glowing pink rectangles she still has before her eyes. She&rsquo;s got no idea what to connect it with.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Perfect!&rsquo; Olka laughed and added Weronika must take better care of herself, after which she took out a rustling 50-zloty note and handed it to Wu, who&rsquo;d just come back from the toilet, asking him to buy another round.</p>

<div class="text-separator"></div>

<p>When they left the pub, it was well after midnight. Freezing still air lay heavy over Poznań, with high banks of snow stretching along its streets, people sneaking occasionally in the light of lampposts, cars going by.</p>
<p>The three of them walked along the white Freedom Square, next to many-branched plane trees, which looked in the street light like they&rsquo;d been taken from a horror film. Olka took Paderewski Street, saying she&rsquo;d drop by Dragon, while Weronika and Wu kept walking along Marcinkowski Avenue, at the feet of the heavy silhouette of the museum, laughing that this bar fly wouldn&rsquo;t be home by six, that&rsquo;s for sure. Weronika was shivering with cold; Wu wrapped his arm around her, so she sunk into his dark blue jacket, barely reaching his shoulder, and they walked unhurriedly towards Greater Poland Square.</p>
<p>&lsquo;She&rsquo;s unsinkable, this one&rsquo;. While saying this, she passed her cheek over the cool fabric. &lsquo;I wonder what kid she&rsquo;s going to pick up tonight&rsquo;.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Probably a fourteen-year-old&rsquo;, said Wu and Weronika, laughing, tightened her grip around his waist. Olka once told her she had not the slightest intention of ever being in a relationship again; when she recovered from depression after her husband&rsquo;s death she decided that from now on she&rsquo;d count only on herself; she said it was like being born anew. Weronika envies her. She herself can&rsquo;t last a month without a guy before all her neuroses start to strike down.</p>
<p>They reached St Adalbert Street and stopped by one of the buildings. Weronika thanked Wu for walking her home, kissed him on the cheek and disappeared into a dark doorway, while he began to slowly walk towards a petrol station and farther &mdash; along Małe Garbary Street.</p>

<div class="text-separator"></div>

<p>He entered one of the tenement houses in Chwaliszewo Street, ascended to the second floor of a dirty staircase and opened the door to a cramped, squalid flat. A large portion of the entrance hall was taken up by a shelf filled with books. The kitchen, which Wu entered first to leave a plastic bag full of bottles of beer, was full of lush vegetation coming out of flowerpots, while the floor space of the two small rooms was largely occupied by cartons filled with clothes, books and papers.</p>
<p>He opened one bottle, put the remaining ones in the fridge, went to a room with a desk and turned on a laptop. For a good dozen minutes he browsed websites, taking an occasional sip of beer, then looking outside the window (where the gaping Czartoria Street fell into Chwaliszewo Street), until he finally started typing.</p>
<p>If you looked over his shoulder, you could see he&rsquo;d logged into a dating site full of pictures of skimpily dressed men. He set the status: &lsquo;Sex. Accom. Now&rsquo; and having looked outside the window and above the roofs at the distant clock of the technical university (it was nearly two), he took a long gulp from the bottle.</p>
<p>Half an hour later, when most windows in the twilit Chwaliszewo Street had gone out, the door phone rang. With a few bounds, Wu crossed the distance separating him from the entrance hall and opened the front door without asking who it was. He left the door ajar and watched the staircase through the crack, listening to footsteps.</p>
<p>He opened it wider when a short figure of a slight dark-haired man appeared at the landing. The man looked up at Wu with his small black eyes, while his prominent lips, standing out clearly against his pale complexion, formed into a smile.</p>
<p>He went inside and took off his black coat, unveiling an equally black sweater clinging to his thin, yet muscular body. He asked, rather idiotically, if he could hang his coat among the other coats, and after a nod from Wu, who wouldn&rsquo;t stop inspecting him, he took off his shoes from his small high-instepped feet, obviously encased in black socks. Wu gazed at them with greed.</p>
<p>The boy looked around the dusky entrance hall and cheered up on seeing the bookcase. For a good minute he scanned the backs of tattered books until Wu offered him a beer.</p>
<p>When he came back from the kitchen, the suddenly emboldened stranger was already sitting on a sofa in the oblong room, under a wall, which hadn&rsquo;t been painted in ages, and eagerly examining the posters covering, though he couldn&rsquo;t know it, some of the bigger chips in the plaster. He took a bottle from Wu and declared he&rsquo;d just seen <i>Before Sunrise</i>, when he had a day off from the bank, because he works in a bank, he&rsquo;s a customer consultant, he likes Linklater quite a lot, there&rsquo;s something about him, it&rsquo;s rather elusive, he doesn&rsquo;t really know what it is in his films that he likes, recently he&rsquo;s also rewatched a few films that have defined him as a human being, you know, Kusturica, that von Trier&rsquo;s trilogy about women sacrificing themselves for the greater good, <i>Amelia</i>, <i>Pulp Fiction</i>, etc.</p>
<p>&lsquo;So?&rsquo; asked Wu, taking advantage of a small pause. He had been sitting for all this time on a chair one metre from the couch, his eyes wandering over the man&rsquo;s body. Not waiting for a response, he stood up, put the bottle down, sat astride the man&rsquo;s lap and kissed him on the mouth.</p>
