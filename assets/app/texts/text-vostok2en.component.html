    <p id="first">A tram number 9 derailed in the district of Wilda, hitting cars.</p>
    <p>Meanwhile, in a completely different part of the city, along the PST (Poznań Fast Tram) line, on tracks laid down in a deep long trench, which &mdash; full of snow &mdash; formed a completely white tunnel, a two-cabin tram number 16 hurtled along like a bullet. Inside people were crowding, the cabins fishtailed at sharper turns, and each time it happened a sudden wave came through the passengers clinging to yellow tubes and the backs of seats, from the front to the back of the cabin, making them for a moment like one organism.</p>
    <p>At the very end of the second cabin, leaning against a railing and staring outside through a dirty pane, stood Weronika (in a red jacket) and some other woman, probably a bit younger: in a black coat, black boots, thick vivid orange tights, wrapped in a black scarf, onto which long straight dark brown hair was falling. Weronika and the girl didn&rsquo;t talk, perhaps the deafening clatter of the wheels on the rails was the reason, and glanced at each other only now and then, for the most part, however, staring absent-mindedly at tracks flashing outside the window. The view behind the panes made up the following sequence: the whiteness of snow, the greyness of concrete (Słowiańska Street Station), the whiteness of snow, the greyness of concrete (Solidarność Avenue Station), and then the whiteness of snow again.</p>
    <p>An oblong barrack of a shopping centre loomed over the tunnel, its elevation illuminated with glaring lights, with a luminous yellow cord undulating along the building, and from the perspective of the rushing tram this edifice could resemble a dignified, slowly swimming whale. When the vehicle reached the next, this time stunningly colourful, station (Lechicka/Poznań Plaza), Weronika told Zuza (that is how she addressed the girl staring through the window) to wake up at last, they needed to get off, and then they both headed for the exit.</p>
    <div class="text-separator"></div>
    <p>No more than two hours later another tram number 16 arrived at a stop in Małe Garbary Street, the automatic door opened, and people started to step out of the green cabins. Among them were Weronika and Zuza, carrying heavy linen bags, inside of which bottles of wine clanked.</p>
    <p>&lsquo;Oh give me a break&rsquo;. Weronika turned her head away. Zuza touched her shoulder in a conciliatory gesture and said she was just worried about her, that&rsquo;s all.</p>
    <p>Yeah, yeah, everyone&rsquo;s worried about Weronika, but at the same time they treat her as if she were twelve.</p>
    <p>&lsquo;Because you behave like you&rsquo;re twelve&rsquo;. Zuza laughed, and Weronika quickly joined her in laughter.</p>
    <p>Zuza added that, all right, she&rsquo;d stop wittering about Jerzy, &rsquo;cause it didn&rsquo;t make much sense anyway and Weronika was going to do what she always did, after which she cursed the never-ending frost and suggested that they go here, to the green, leave their bags on the bench and smoke, &rsquo;cause another few minutes without a cig and she&rsquo;d go nuts.</p>
    <p>Weronika, heading with Zuza towards the green, uttered a long sigh. She gets it, she knows that what she&rsquo;s doing is totally dumb and nothing good&rsquo;s going to come of it, but there&rsquo;s something about Jerzy that she can&rsquo;t free herself of; anyhow, maybe they should change the topic, and a smoke is a great idea. They left their bags on a dilapidated bench, Zuza took out a pack of cigarettes, offered one to her friend, they started to smoke, there was a row of cars standing in the street, a tram crossing the intersection, while the snow around them covered a layer of dead grass, animal faeces, litter, broken glass. The cigarette smoke was milky from the frost.</p>
    <p>Zuza asked whether Weronika&rsquo;d seen the coverage from the attack scene. You have to admit it was a spectacular job, the damage was really massive, and it&rsquo;ll take years to patch up the rifts in the city infrastructure.</p>
    <p>She paused mid-sentence, as she saw someone: along the untended path crossing the green walked a fairly tall blond man in an olive jacket with a white cap pulled over his ears. On seeing the girls, he gave a wide grin and walked over to them.</p>
    <p>They talked for a while, the man decided to have a smoke as well, Weronika and Zuza called him Kuba, Kuba asked whether they were going to Mięsna that night, to which they replied they were preparing a small party at Wu&rsquo;s, but Kuba should drop by since he&rsquo;d be in the neighbourhood anyway. There&rsquo;ll only be a few of them, there&rsquo;ll be squid and the ratio of bottles of wine to participants looks very promising. Kuba replied he&rsquo;d think about it, &rsquo;cause he was working on some &lsquo;friend&rsquo;, as he called her, but he can equally well work on her at Wu&rsquo;s, after which he said he must be going, &rsquo;cause it was his tram, but he&rsquo;d let them know.</p>
    <p>The girls finished off their cigarettes, put them out against the edge of the bench, lifted the heavy bags full of wine, bread, vegetables, cephalopods, headed towards a zebra crossing and &mdash; after waiting several minutes at a red light &mdash; kept going along Estkowski Street to carefully walk down an ice-covered escarpment to a place where the Warta River once flowed but now it was a sports field and a row of parking spaces, cross this field, walk among cars parked in the snow, go past a row of tin garages (black-and-white graffiti on the walls) and walk further, towards Chwaliszewo Street.</p>

    <div class="text-separator"></div>

    <p>The kitchen walls were covered with ragged dark pink wallpaper; on the squalid kitchen cabinets, on the kitchen worktop, on the fridge stood flowerpots spewing out tangled shoots of ivy. Once you entered the kitchen, you had the impression it&rsquo;s a freeze-frame from a film and one careless move would be enough for the whole room to be consumed, in a split second, by the vividly green vegetation.</p>
    <p>Weronika and Zuza sat at the table, covered with plastic cloth and crammed with bottles of wine, a bowl full of (deep-fried) squid in beer batter, a plate of lemons, an ashtray. Wu, on the other hand, stood opposite them, leaning against the kitchen worktop and tapping his leg along to music coming from a laptop placed on top of the fridge. The three of them all drank red wine from glasses; once in a while cigarette ends lighted up above the table. Weronika said she&rsquo;d dreamt about small glowing pink rectangles, the same as during that drunken night. She laughed, said she must have taken some shit while under the influence, or that chap, whoever he was, slipped a date rape drug into her cocktail, as Kuba generously suggested. Speaking of Kuba, where is he? They should call him to come by. Wu sighed and already started chastening Weronika, saying she needed to take care of herself, &rsquo;cause she was really going over the top this time and it couldn&rsquo;t fucking end well, when a loud ring of the doorbell interrupted him.</p>
    <p>Wu disappeared into the entrance hall, a cold draught from the staircase entered the kitchen, one could hear &mdash; in spite of the blaring music &mdash; increasingly louder steps on the stairs, and, after a moment, Olka entered, uttering a cheerful &lsquo;hi there!&rsquo; (She was followed by Wu carrying an armful of new bottles of wine.) Olka forced her way through the grey smoke to kiss Weronika and Zuza, declared she&rsquo;d come only for a minute, &rsquo;cause she needed to go to sleep at a reasonable hour, but she&rsquo;d love to taste the legendary squid. Then she took a cigarette in her hand and began to look for a lighter. Weronika lifted a burning match in front of Olka&rsquo;s face, saying Kuba was supposed to be here as well, but he&rsquo;s working on some chick, so no one knows if he&rsquo;s going to come.</p>
    <p>Yeah, Olka knows, she saw them yesterday in Dragon. She reached into the bowl for a piece of squid flesh coated in breadcrumbs, devoured it in one go and continued saying this chick was a tough one. For the whole evening Kuba pretended to be interested in pharmacy, as she was some pharmacy student, whispered in her ear that he&rsquo;d love to see her in a lab coat and protective eyewear, he almost started naming his favourite medications, when the girl interrupted him mid-sentence, saying it&rsquo;d been very nice, but she must be home by midnight. She even tricked him into paying for the cab.</p>
    <p>Wu, flipping through songs on the computer, said Kuba never liked the easy way. To Zuza&rsquo;s remark, expressing her irritation with the constant change of music, he reacted with unchanging composure, saying he was looking for a piece he&rsquo;d listened to while wasted the night before. He totally can&rsquo;t remember which one it was. Or maybe he&rsquo;s imagining things.</p>
    <p>Finally he resigned, played a random track, leant against the wall and said those terrorist are batshit crazy. Watching their speech sent shivers down his spine. On the other hand, they shouldn&rsquo;t be surprised: the authorities have treated them like cattle for centuries, and when you look at this now, it&rsquo;s hard to believe we were so naïve. This was bound to happen eventually. Though there must have been a lot of bluff in all this; it&rsquo;s impossible they have the technology they were talking about.</p>
    <p>Could Weronika, please, relax with a glass of wine on her day off, without being forced to hearing about those fuckers all the time? (For a while she&rsquo;d been squatting on a chair upholstered in leatherette, with a glass in her hand and rolling her eyes at times.)</p>
    <p>&lsquo;You&rsquo;re lucky you&rsquo;ve got a day off&rsquo;, retorted Zuza, who &mdash; as she quickly added &mdash; hadn&rsquo;t had a day off in three weeks, because her greed made her take on another translation, though her schedule was already full, and to top this all off Weronika has been dragging her round the shops and tricked her into cooking some bloody squid, just as if she knew how to cook.</p>
    <p>&lsquo;Oh, have a drink&rsquo;. Weronika laughed, filling up Zuza&rsquo;s glass.</p>
    <div class="text-separator"></div>
    <p>The events of the rest of this evening could be captured in stills: Wu leaning against the fridge, Zuza, Weronika and Olka at the table, bright dots of burning tobacco. Next, a similar scene, but with Kuba and a dainty bright-haired girl standing in the doorway, the girl was pale and had big blue eyes, she barely spoke a word. Then the dark pink kitchen, Weronika and Zuza above an empty bowl, the former complaining about her complicated relationship with Jerzy, a cloud of grey smoke above their heads. Half an hour later at the table sat Weronika, Zuza and Kuba, Kuba had just seen his blonde friend to a cab and told the girls someone must have got pretty stoned, &rsquo;cause they&rsquo;d broken into the military museum and stolen a war scythe. Even later, a similar scene: Wu standing in the doorway with a bottle of wine saying Olka had gone to Dragon after all, but promised she&rsquo;d be back, which meant she wouldn&rsquo;t. Then a bulb blowing out, darkness instantly filling the kitchen. Later again the rest of them sitting by candlelight, against the background of the wallpaper, which seemed almost black in this lighting, Weronika immersed in a greenish glow beaming from the phone and texting. After one more hour there was only Wu, Kuba and Zuza, the latter saying it always ends like this, sooner or later Jerzy calls and after ten minutes Weronika&rsquo;s gone. And the last scene: a candle burning out, Wu and Kuba sitting in silence above the last of the wine, with lustreless eyes, smoking; the room was tightly filled with smoke, the smoke was as dense as fog.</p>
