    <p id="first">She said she remembered the navy-blue sky over Międzymoście Square, there were white clouds below the sky, gulls against the background of the clouds, and she was walking with that dude, whatever his name was, she must have got herself wasted really badly. They walked like that between one guarded car park and another, now she almost recalls his face, he might have had thick black eyebrows, protruding cheekbones, he was saying something, they were talking, they might have said something about Venus, about Ceres. Next Chwaliszewo Street, Czartoria Street, the broken lamppost kept flickering while they were necking in front of the off-licence. She remembers she felt the texture of a navy-blue jacket under her fingers; the frost seemed to pierce her with small daggers. They kept walking, perhaps towards the river, she&rsquo;s just remembered he helped her down the ice-covered embankment, she guesses there were some other people, can&rsquo;t remember how many, her lips were chapping, she totally can&rsquo;t recall their faces. They stood for some time under the bridge, the motionless ice-bound white river, they were talking, she was completely drunk, it was night, trams no longer ran, until one moment the bloke who&rsquo;d led her there took out a box from his pocket, and a small object out of it &mdash; a rectangle giving off pink, fluorescent light. And then nothing, a complete blank.</p>
    <p>Olka laughed. No soap opera is better than Weronika&rsquo;s stories about her drunken excesses, and she just can&rsquo;t wait for new episodes, because each one is a whole new level of absurdity. Weronika whined it wasn&rsquo;t funny, she&rsquo;d got totally blotto, she couldn&rsquo;t have drunk that much, that guy must have slipped something into her cocktail, and what&rsquo;s with those rectangles, maybe she was hallucinating or dreamed the whole thing, but in the last few days, whenever she closes her eyes, she sees small pink bloody rectangles, it&rsquo;s driving her nuts, and on top of it there&rsquo;s that girl under the bridge. She stopped, hid her face in her palms and let out a theatrical sigh. Olka laid her hand on Weronika&rsquo;s forearm and told her to calm down, nothing really happened, she just needed to take a better care of herself, said she&rsquo;d been through a lot, this whole situation with Jerzy and all, said it was going to be okay, she simply needed to work some things out, after which she downed a shot of vodka with one swift move.</p>
    <p>They were sitting in Mięsna. Snow was melting on the dirty floor, they were set against a wallpaper with a concentric orange and purple pattern, a lamp with a plastic shade, the interior was dense with cigarette smoke, loud with music, crowded with people, bartenders behind the counter poured beer into plastic mugs, as they&rsquo;d apparently run out of glasses. From the main room you could go upstairs, where there was a dance floor surrounded by different wallpaper with a pattern in shades of purple and orange and full of passive bodies of tipsy twenty-year-olds bending to the music. You could also, through a currently closed door, go down to the basement with a small stage. If places had memory, the yellowish walls of this room could still feel the touch of bodies swarming in a darkroom, which was located in here just a few years earlier.</p>
    <p>&lsquo;By the way&rsquo;, said Olka, &lsquo;tell me how things between you and Jerzy are. Is there any chance it&rsquo;s going to work out this time?&rsquo;</p>
    <p>Weronika glanced at a bearded DJ behind turntables, at drunken people in their twenties swarming around the bar and replied to her ever more inebriated friend that she didn&rsquo;t really know. Please, let Olka not mention it to Zuza or Wu, but they&rsquo;ve already managed to have two deadly quarrels. That night when Ania got killed they fought so badly she walked home all the way from Winogrady to the centre. But we&rsquo;ll see.</p>
    <p>&lsquo;And that thing with Zuza and this guy&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
    <p>Jacek? It didn&rsquo;t work out. They went on a few dates, and then Zuza retreated. Olka gave an understanding nod only to ask, as if struck by a sudden thought, &lsquo;Has Zuza ever been in a serious relationship at all?&rsquo;</p>
    <p>On hearing this question, Weronika stammered, looked to both sides in reflection, then again at Olka, who suddenly burst into laughter.</p>
    <p>&lsquo;Well, well. And I thought you were such besties&rsquo;.</p>
    <p>Come on, Olka&rsquo;s fully aware what Zuza&rsquo;s like; it&rsquo;s hard to get her out of her shell. And she&rsquo;s such a good listener. (Olka couldn&rsquo;t stop laughing.) Weronika remained silent for a while, let out a nervous chuckle and finally asked whether she&rsquo;s really such an egocentric person.</p>
    <p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t worry. Zuza doesn&rsquo;t seem to be bothered&rsquo;.</p>
    <p>Weronika, somewhat embarrassed, took a big gulp of beer, after which she changed the subject, saying she was worried about Wu, he&rsquo;d been working too much lately, sitting at his laptop from early morning until late night and banging on the keys, and the last thing he needed was a story with a corpse under the bridge.</p>
    <p>Olka eyed Weronika in silence for a moment, as if a little concerned, against the background of the bar, the lights, the clouds of smoke, turning over a lighter in her hand, until she finally asked, or rather stated, &lsquo;You&rsquo;re not over it yet, are you?&rsquo;</p>

    <div class="text-separator"></div>

    <p>After Mięsna it was time for Dragon, for pushing one&rsquo;s way through the crowd, drinking vodka at the bar, smoking cigarettes, for superficial conversations with friends and freshly befriended people, for drunken looks at blurred lights. In just twenty minutes, the completely intoxicated Olka managed to knock two beers from the bar with her elbow, put out a butt-end in someone&rsquo;s cocktail and insult her fiftyish-looking friend by asking her how she was coping with her old age.</p>
    <p>Meanwhile Weronika, also drunker by the minute, sat on the small wooden stairs at the door to the garden and watched people, silently sipping cherry vodka on ice (freezing air wafted through the crack under the door). After a while she started poking around her pockets to eventually reach for her jacket lying on the side and take out the phone; immersed in a greenish glow and slurping alcohol through a straw, she began to type a text message.</p>
    <p>Suddenly she raised her eyes and saw a man in front of her, who had been standing there motionless for at least a minute: not too tall, of a rather slight build, with a few-day-old stubble and prominent lips. He asked if he could join her and, without waiting for Weronika&rsquo;s reply, sat next to her on the wooden step.</p>
    <p>Said his name was Staszek and he&rsquo;d been in town since very recently and didn&rsquo;t know too many people, asked whether Weronika came here often and, having received no response, began to blab about his musical interests. Weronika kept typing. Her strained face and blank stare suggested it caused her considerable difficulty. She kept sipping cherry vodka through a straw and seemed to completely ignore Staszek, who said he&rsquo;d never really liked Tori Amos&rsquo;s music, but got hold of her double record from the late nineties, which he found somewhat interesting, especially the arrangements, and the lyrics, which &mdash; as always in the case of this artist &mdash; were definitely noteworthy. As Weronika remained unimpressed with Staszek&rsquo;s digressions about popular music (the smell of his cologne lingered in the air), he clearly decided to show his wide reading and started to talk about his interest in classic science fiction. He proudly told her that after much hardship he&rsquo;d got his hands on the anthology <i>Farewell Fantastic Venus</i>, the first edition from 1968 (when he talked, his protruding Adam&rsquo;s able moved and his muscles shifted under his T-shirt), until all of a sudden he asked Weronika&rsquo;s name.</p>
    <p>She stopped pressing on the keys and looked at Staszek for the first time. After a moment of silence she introduced herself, remarked it was a pleasure, only to take the last sip of her cocktail, put the glass down on the step, get up and, having grabbed her jacket, start forcing her way towards the exit.</p>
    <p>She told Staszek, who was following her, that no, he didn&rsquo;t have to see her home, and no, she wouldn&rsquo;t give him her number, and they&rsquo;d surely come across each other many times, &rsquo;cause in this shitty city there are maybe four decent pubs, after which she opened the door to the street and walked out into the burning frost.</p>

    <div class="text-separator"></div>

    <p>Above the ice-bound river hung a dark, equally still sky, it was the middle of the night, the lights of Poznań were slowly going out, from a bird&rsquo;s-eye view one could see the individual districts: Rataje, Sołacz, Łazarz, Winogrady, plunge deeper and deeper into impenetrable darkness. The only visible thing left now was a network of streets lit with the pale glow of lampposts.</p>
    <p>In the shade of Chrobry Bridge, right above the frozen Warta, you could see a moving bright point. If you looked at it with human eyes, which gradually adjust to darkness, you could see an ever sharper outline of a silhouette, a shaking hand, a visibly anxious face. The luminous point glowed for the last time, and Wu tossed the butt-end towards the river. Then, using his mobile phone as a torch, he started raking up snow in the place where a few nights earlier he had found the slit-open corpse of a woman.</p>
    <p>After several minutes of clearly futile search, he put his phone back into his pocket and took a few steps towards a pillar of the bridge, when a silent crack sounded under his shoe. He crouched, took out the phone again, shone it under his feet and dug out a small black object from the whiteness. He swept snow from its smooth, slightly fractured surface and then it became clear it was an mp3 player (it shone vaguely in the nocturnal light).</p>
    <p>Without hesitation, he took a pair of tangled earphones out of his pocket, plugged them into the player, placed them in his ears and pushed a big black button. On the dark surface flashed the text &lsquo;track 05&rsquo;, and a moment later Wu&rsquo;s eardrums were hit by a clear and powerful, seemingly multiplied sound of French horns which played an unhurried, melancholic, insistently repeated phrase. A dozen seconds passed, and the text disappeared, the music fell silent.</p>

    <div class="text-separator"></div>

    <p>Small glowing pink rectangles, I can see them whenever I close my eyes, the navy-blue sky over Międzymoście Square, the white clouds below the sky, the grey gulls, guarded car parks, frost like small daggers plunged into the body, once again we walk towards the river, neck in front of the off-licence, the scratching of his stubble, once again the pink rectangles, something about Venus, about Ceres, Chwaliszewo Street, the lamppost like a strobe light, Czartoria Street, walking down the ice-covered embankment,</p>
    <p>now sitting in my kitchen, everything&rsquo;s still grey, the snow-covered St Adalbert Street outside the window, the blurred outlines of the kitchen furniture and fridge getting sharper by the minute, the light from the laptop that must make me look like a ghost, strange sobriety, the last of the last beer, my hands still trembling, I look at the curtain edges, then close my eyes, the small pink bloody rectangles, the words of our quarrel still resounding in my head like a broken record, insults shouted by Jerzy, the sound of a shattered glass, the rustle of clothes packed in a hurry, my own weirdly alien voice, screaming that if I feel like it, I&rsquo;ll let half of the city shag me, and it&rsquo;s none of his business, because it&rsquo;s over, a door slam,</p>
    <p>the pink rectangles, in my mind I walk out again, heated into the cold night, stand in front of the block of flats, Cosmonauts Estate is silent and unreal, my hand struggles to hold a cigarette when I try to light it, the smoke irritates my throat, sore from all the screaming, the light of the lampposts, the blue door of the block of flats, its wall painted in blue rectangles, blue gutters and the equally blue bench and fence enclosing a white lawn, I need to keep it together, naked branches casting tangled shadows on the snow, I start to sob and, a few minutes later, walk across the roundabout, empty at that hour, under the night sky heavy with white clouds, wondering what Zuza and Wu are going to say, I can almost see their concerned but smug faces, they always know better, and I always get myself into the same sick situations,</p>
    <p>stop thinking about it, St Adalbert Street outside the window, almost no beer left, there&rsquo;s still a little wine in the fridge, lurid light, drinking straight from the bottle, the pinkness of the rectangles under my eyelids, thinking about Wu, suddenly it&rsquo;s the first weeks of our friendship, it&rsquo;s early summer and we go together to the Warta River, to the sun-burnt grasses, to be devoured by mosquitoes, we sit down on the concrete river bank, still warm from the scorching day, looking at the river&rsquo;s waters, listening to the hum of cars on Chrobry Bridge, drinking <i>krupnik </i>straight from the bottle and talking, it turns out we read the same books, go to the same films, have confusingly similar reflections on the emptiness and pointlessness of life, something about Venus, about Ceres, it&rsquo;s getting colder, Wu wraps his arm around me, goose pimples all over my body, suddenly my breathing gets faster and I feel a desire to take him home, for eternal exclusivity, and make love to him all night until dawn, because I don&rsquo;t know yet that in a week&rsquo;s time he&rsquo;ll introduce me to his boyfriend,</p>
    <p>the small pink rectangles, pink blood gushing from arteries, I dive again into the coolness of the deserted Winogrady Street, feeling agitated after my quarrel with Jerzy, walk along the row of villas and the park lurking behind them, on top of the sparkling, well-trodden snow, I can&rsquo;t stop thinking about the terrorists&rsquo; new announcement, Antarctic landscapes and threats spoken by a speech synthesizer, the beating of my heart, dark windows line the street on both sides, people sleeping behind them, likely dreaming about their relationships, children and problems at work, the pink rectangles under my eyelids, and I have the ever more palpable presentiment that all this might suddenly vanish: those villas, that dark park, tramlines, all the bus stops, streets and blocks of flats, all the shops, and I, who walk crying in the middle of the freezing night,</p>
    <p>thinking what it is that makes me come back to Jerzy over and over, push my way repeatedly into his no longer young arms, I&rsquo;m starting to regret I told him about that guy, with whom I went to the river and who must have slipped something into my drink, about that kiss under the lamppost, about the ice-covered embankment, about the small pink rectangle, okay, perhaps I was trying to get together with Jerzy at that time, but we weren&rsquo;t a couple yet, I didn&rsquo;t think he could be jealous of such a thing, though Jerzy can be jealous of anything really,</p>
    <p>almost no wine left, the kitchen almost completely bright, the walls bright pink once again and I&rsquo;m standing once more in front of Dawid, the first of the series of arseholes Wu fell for, at first I don&rsquo;t feel a thing, I have the impression I am being lifted high above Poznań, they stay down below, Wu touting questionable attributes of the slightly chubby blond in a way too tight T-shirt, and I keep looking at all this without emotion from the height of hundreds of metres, my sight can embrace all the districts, Winogrady, Grunwald, Wilda, Rataje, finally I come back down to the ground, talk to them for a few minutes and, on my way home, buy a half-litre bottle of <i>żołądkowa </i>and two cartons of grapefruit juice to drink disgustingly warm cocktails and cry long into the night.</p>
