    <p id="first">A heavy dark sky hung above the city, it was night, Poznań&rsquo;s blocks of flats and tenement houses remained dormant, lampposts cast a lurid light, snow lay heavy on the roofs, while a strong, piercing wind ran along the network of the streets; it carried frost.</p>
    <p>In the light from the street you could see unfocused outlines of the furniture and cartons, crumpled bedding, Wu tossing and turning, you could smell the pungent scent of tobacco smoke, hear muffled voices of brawling chavs. Finally Wu sighed, got up from the bed, walked through the darkness of the entrance hall to the darkness of the kitchen, then groped for the switch, pushed it, and when in spite of this it was still dark, he silently cursed the blown out bulb. He felt around the worktop to find a bottle of mineral water and started to drink it &mdash; with fast, greedy gulps.</p>
    <p>Twenty minutes later he was already walking along Garbary Street, there was no one within the range of his sight, some dead-drunk girl lay in one of the doorways, but he couldn&rsquo;t possibly see it, so he walked, trembling with cold, towards Bernardine Square, passed a shop selling telescopes (a bloated Jupiter in the poster next to the entrance), a row of black shop windows, a chemist&rsquo;s &lsquo;Wenus&rsquo;.</p>
    <p>Then he followed the tramline towards the river, Mostowa Street at this time of day was dark and motionless, no cars were approaching, so Wu walked diagonally to the other side and kept striding along the street, only to take a right turn before Roch Bridge and go down a steep embankment to the very edge of the river. The Warta River was ice-bound and covered with a thick layer of snow, the sky whitish from the glow of the city, Wu smoked and walked slowly along the invisible bank, and while walking, he sometimes squinted his eyes and massaged his eyelids with his fingers, like one does to soothe an unbearable headache.</p>
    <p>One time when he opened his eyes, and it was when he had nearly reached Chrobry Bridge, he suddenly stopped to stare for a moment, straining his eyes, into the dark space under the bridge&rsquo;s deck. Right next to the bank, under a pillar loomed some shape. Wu hesitated, then took a few steps forward, approaching the shape to a distance at which one could already see it was a girl kneeling in an unnatural pose, strangely bent forwards. He asked if everything was all right. Silence. After a moment he came even nearer, an arm&rsquo;s length away, and &mdash; with hesitation &mdash; gently touched her shoulder, but the girl didn&rsquo;t budge. Finally he took a phone from his pocket and shone it on her face.</p>
    <p>The reddish light revealed a mouth gagged with a decent-sized lemon, blue, ghastly open eyes, hands tied behind the back and a belly slit open to pour a ripe cluster of guts onto the snow.</p>
    <div class="text-separator"></div>
    <p>Meanwhile, a little more than three kilometres to the north, along Murawa Street, between the cuboid blocks of flats of Wuthering Heights Estate on one side and of Cosmonauts Estate on the other, Weronika walked with a shaky gait, smoking a cigarette, crying, uttering silent curses and at times wiping her tears with the back of her trembling hand. When she was approaching Solidarność Roundabout, the almost absolute silence of the city was suddenly interrupted by a phone ringing. She tossed one more &lsquo;fuck&rsquo;, hurled a butt-end into the snow (it cut across the air like a comet roaring with fire) and started to nervously poke around her pockets. Finally she took out the mobile phone and once she saw who was calling, her face, now drenched in a green glow, filled with anxiety.</p>
    <p>She picked up. Whoever was calling, she told him: calm down, one thing at a time, slowly, from the beginning, listened in silence to a voice coming from the receiver, growing paler by the second, until she finally crouched and hid her face in her palm. She muttered they must stay calm, she&rsquo;d be right there, everything would be fine. The voice in the receiver said something, she asked if he was really going to be okay, &rsquo;cause she could take a cab any minute, although he might be right, it probably doesn&rsquo;t make much sense, let him just call her when they stop questioning him. She stayed silent for a moment, taking heavy breaths, the voice in the receiver also grew silent, until she finally asked, &lsquo;What about Kuba? Does he know?&rsquo;</p>

    <div class="text-separator"></div>

    <p>The main area of the pub Dragon was filled with the smell of incense, cigarette smoke hanging above the tables, sad music coming from the speakers, people crowding densely along the bar, in front of whom and behind the bartenders&rsquo; backs one could see a row of long shelves filled with bottles of liquor. Over the scene loomed a carved dragon head, protruding from the wall and painted black.</p>
    <p>The pub itself was an enormous, multi-level creation: beneath the main area there was a stifling basement with another bar and a cramped dance floor; from the main room one could also go outside to the garden &mdash; this time of year claustrophobic and covered with snow. From the garden, via a narrow stairway, you could reach higher levels: another bar behind a swing door, through which you could go to a second garden on a high terrace snuggled against a weather-beaten wall; to a room opposite this bar; to another room above it &mdash; and yet another, fitted on a wooden mezzanine above the bar. From one of these rooms you could get &mdash; through a usually closed door &mdash; to subsequent spaces: a room housing concerts and author meetings, and from there &mdash; to yet another bar. Dragon was like a slow-spreading cancer each year occupying new spaces of the old tenement house, appropriating new rooms and corridors, and no one seemed to have any doubt that one day it would engulf it all.</p>
    <p>In the corner of the main room, next to a door leading to the garden, in the soft light of a shaded floor lamp, Zuza and Wu reclined on a sofa, accompanied by a stooped Kuba sitting on a comfy pouf. On the table stood three barely touched beer mugs; in the middle, a vase with white tulips. The three of them remained silent almost all the time, smoking unhurriedly and looking somewhere ahead.</p>
    <p>&lsquo;Can&rsquo;t believe it&rsquo;, murmured Kuba and leant down to wet his lips with the beer. He just can&rsquo;t get his head around it. Okay, he saw Ania a second time in his life and had no serious plans for her, but such things, fuck, just should not happen. Though maybe that&rsquo;s the reason he feels so shitty about it. And the way they killed her. Like in some slaughterhouse.</p>
    <p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t torture yourself&rsquo;. Wu touched his shoulder for a moment. &lsquo;What could you do?&rsquo;</p>
    <p>He knows, he knows. After all, he saw her off to that cab, paid for the fare. He even started to suspect she was seeing him only because of those cab rides.  &rsquo;Cause there was no way he could talk her into sleeping with him. He saw her drive away, so how is it possible that she found herself back by the river? One hundred metres from Wu&rsquo;s place?</p>
    <p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m going to fucking implode&rsquo;, interrupted Weronika, who had just come from behind the bar to sit on Wu&rsquo;s lap and, having leaned towards the table, take a cigarette of out a pack and ask if anyone had a lighter.</p>
    <p>It must be some punishment that she works behind a bar when she almost viscerally hates people. She should have consulted a career advisor or something. But wait, she can&rsquo;t do anything else anyway.</p>
    <p>&lsquo;How&rsquo;re you doing?&rsquo; she asked, tenderly ruffling Kuba&rsquo;s blond mop of hair, once she stopped laughing at her own joke.</p>
    <p>&lsquo;As you can see&rsquo;, he grunted, clenching his fists in turn (his joints softly crackled). Zuza, who remained silent for this whole time, looked at his wrists covered in bright down. And all those interrogations, he&rsquo;s going there again tomorrow. How much can you take?</p>
    <p>They fell silent and got back to listless smoking and drinking. People crowded in queues outside the bathroom and at the bar, some visibly inebriated man in his twenties staggered towards Kuba, almost spilling his drink on him, while the speakers now played a jauntier, electronic piece.</p>
    <p>&lsquo;Break&rsquo;s over&rsquo;, Weronika finally announced with resignation, put out the cigarette, kissed Wu&rsquo;s temple and got back behind the bar.</p>
    <p>Wu followed her with his eyes and happened upon a pair of small black eyes piercing him. A short black-haired man of slight build, pale face and prominent lips, the one who paid Wu a night-time visit two days earlier, was sitting on a bar stool in front of a small beer. He stared at Wu for a moment with a timid smile, finished his beer, and once he had drained it, he stood up from the bar and started forcing his way through the clump of people, towards the exit.</p>
