<div class="story obrovsky">
    <p id="first">I am the city of greyness and mould: all its dim streets and blackened houses. I am the air that, heavy with smog, finds its way into bedrooms, living rooms, kitchens and moist lungs. I am a flock of pigeons, which &mdash; too lazy to fly &mdash; disperse in all directions running from a bike. Drunkards on a bench are also me, like the bright lights of an off-license, like the snow, like the naked maples.</p>
    <p>At the same moment I am hundreds of metres above the ground and deep, deep under &mdash; where the earth is cold and full of earthworms. I am in a thousand rooms at once. With my thousand eyes I can see brown and yellow and black and pink wallpaper, myriad bathroom tiles, radiators, furniture made of glass and plywood. I am waterworks and pipelines, floors and ceilings, staircases and lift shafts. I am trams and buses.</p>
    <p>In one of the rooms of one of the flats I can see a familiar figure. Naked, balancing on a hairy leg, he tries to put on his briefs. There&rsquo;s a pile of clothes in front of him: right next to the door, as if he left it there to ease his way out. If that was the plan, it isn&rsquo;t quite working. He pulls the briefs half-way up only to notice they&rsquo;re inside out. He bends down to take them off and put them on again, his skin covered in sweat, fat on his belly forming a fold. Then he slides his big foot into a brightly striped sock. Failing to find the other one, he reaches for his trousers.</p>
    <p>He says his name, by the way, is Viktor, and scratches his dark, patchy beard. A young blond man lying nude on a bed replies with an &lsquo;okay&rsquo;, barely looking away from a smartphone in his hand.</p>
    <p>The room is small and shaped like a truncated rectangle. The only window is covered with a drab piece of cloth. There&rsquo;s a messy desk, a small stove; the walls, once blue, haven&rsquo;t been painted in ages: the paint is flaking, uncovering layers of different colours. I am in this room and all the other rooms of this long and narrow flat, full of old furniture and lined with dirty carpets. In the remaining rooms there are three men in their twenties: one playing a video game, one drinking beer in front of a laptop and one reading notes.</p>
    <p>&lsquo;So what do you do?&rsquo; Viktor asks the young naked man.</p>
    <p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m a student&rsquo;.</p>
    <p>&lsquo;And what do you study?&rsquo;</p>
    <p>In response, he just smacks his lips with a mischievous look.</p>
    <p>Viktor dives under the bed for the missing sock. Before he gets to his feet again, he kisses the boy&rsquo;s shin, sparsely covered with bright hair. He puts on his shoes (lacing them takes ages), then his black duffle coat, says a cheerful &lsquo;bye&rsquo; and leaves the room. Through a cramped entrance hall and down a gloomy staircase, I follow him into the night.</p>
    <p>When I get close to Viktor&rsquo;s skin, it sparkles. Teslavska Street borrows its name from Teslav itself, where it once led before the city engulfed it hundreds of years ago. Both sides are tightly filled with grim tenement houses; there are no trees, only cars parked on the narrow pavement, occupying most of the space.</p>
    <p>&lsquo;What&rsquo;ve you been doing in there?&rsquo; asks David, bald and bearded as always, flicking ash off a cigarette onto the snow-covered ground. A few inches taller than Viktor, he stops and gazes down at him with amusement.</p>
    <p>He says &lsquo;nothing&rsquo;, says he was just viewing a flat, then he looks away and, with his forefinger, draws a circle on the back of his head.</p>
    <p>David examines him, saying he didn&rsquo;t realise things between the two of them were this rough, to which Viktor quickly replies they aren&rsquo;t, it&rsquo;s just in case, no need to talk about it.</p>
    <p>David&rsquo;s scalp is covered with a thin layer of petroleum jelly. I pass through it to reach the strata of dead epidermal cells and go deeper &mdash; to the soft skin embroidered with small vessels, and deeper &mdash; to the spongy skull. Another me dives through his leather jacket, grey jumper and crumpled T-shirt to a muscular chest densely covered with red hair. The thicket sprouts down a fuzzy shoot, which divides the stomach in half, only to erupt with a cluster of shortly trimmed hair on the lower abdomen. Inside his body there are garlands of shiny guts, a dark liver, a big, meaty heart and moving, nicotine-filled lungs.</p>
    <p>David eyes his uneasy-looking friend for another few seconds and finally lets out a short laugh, pats him on the arm and suggests they go to Astroskopia.</p>
    <p>Viktor looks both ways and crosses the cobbled street, a little stooped, his hands buried in his pockets. David follows him. When they reach the other side, Viktor asks about the interview.</p>
    <p>&lsquo;Usual bullshit&rsquo;, says David. They asked him where he saw himself in five years. Well, hopefully not working at a call centre.</p>
    <p>&lsquo;But how did it go?&rsquo;</p>
    <p>David can&rsquo;t say. Those recruiters are all like robots asking the same questions over and over. They could easily be replaced with lottery machines.</p>
    <p>The air starts to move, licking the shiny roofs and pavements. They go past a dilapidated building tightly wrapped in a black mesh (I can see all of its rooms; they&rsquo;re full of dust and darkness) and turn right, into a narrow, dimly lit street. A chain of pink lights around the entrance to Astroskopia pulsates in a heart-beat manner, beckoning them closer. As if hypnotised, they cross the slippery asphalt and reach the glazed door, which reveals an interior of the deepest shade of fuchsia. They enter, and the wind grows stronger.</p>
    <p>The faint striped pattern of the wallpaper makes one think of freshly cut muscle. The pub is empty save for two twenty-year-old men kissing passionately on a wooden mezzanine, but David and Viktor can&rsquo;t possibly see them. The mezzanine, entwined with more pulsating lights, takes up a large part of the small room. In its shade there are soft red sofas and wooden tables. Identical sofas and tables are under the opposite wall.</p>
    <p>They enter the second room; I follow them a thousand-fold. A tall pine-wood counter cuts a large square out of the room, leaving only a narrow passage outside. Behind the counter there is a sink, a dark barred window (covered from the inside by a shelf full of colourful liquors) and a coffee machine, above which, on the wall, there&rsquo;s a hand-painted oval logo spelling the pub&rsquo;s name.</p>
    <p>&lsquo;Why&rsquo;s it so quiet in here?&rsquo; asks David when a door opens and Anya enters the room. Tying up her auburn hair, she cheerfully replies she was hoping to drive away potential clients, but evidently she needs to try harder. &lsquo;Usual?&rsquo;</p>
    <p>Viktor and David take off their coats and sit on wooden bar stools. Anya&rsquo;s freckled face is tense with concentration as she looks through the playlist. She chooses a song and closes the laptop&rsquo;s lid. A soft electronic beat starts to seep from the speakers, followed by the mournful sounds of violins and cellos.</p>
    <p>Jesus, she hates these colours, she feels like she works inside a vagina. Pouring the first glass of beer, she gives a deep sigh. Wrinkles around her eyes betray she&rsquo;s nearly forty, but her face has some hint of girlish freshness. She breathes in and I enter her lungs.</p>
    <p>When Anya grabs a long lighter, one of those used to light grave candles, and leaves the room, Viktor takes the first, unhurried sip.</p>
    <p>&lsquo;Tell me more&rsquo;, he says, beating out the rhythm of the track on the counter.</p>
    <p>&lsquo;What about?&rsquo;</p>
    <p>&lsquo;The interview&rsquo;.</p>
    <p>To the accompaniment of muffled snaps of the lighter, David starts talking. As he describes the monumental shiny S.E.R.C.E. headquarters, with a vast lobby and bright, sterile hallways, I am kilometres away and walk the now dark entrails of the building: countless offices, corridors, staircases and lab rooms. Built on the edge of the city centre, the smog-covered high-rise resembles a shard of glass, its shiny surface reflecting the surrounding black trees, traffic lights and once-red tenement roofs. At the heart of the building there&rsquo;s an enormous multi-storey library. Individual floors, connected with a multitude of winding stairs, open themselves towards its centre, where a soaring banana tree grows. Each floor is heavy with even rows of bookcases.</p>
    <p>&lsquo;Hey, you two up there, it&rsquo;s not a darkroom!&rsquo; comes Anya&rsquo;s voice from the doorway. Viktor and David exchange an amused look.</p>
    <p>Suddenly, it&rsquo;s two hours later. Both rooms become loud and full of people. It gets darker, since the ceiling lamps are off and the pub is lit only by chains of pulsating lights and flickering candles. Dense cigarette smoke fills the interior.</p>
    <p>Anya, now visibly drunk, is engaged in a conversation with a bunch of young women sitting by the counter. She complains about her PhD thesis she can&rsquo;t seem to finish, as she spends most nights in this psychedelic nightmare of a pub. At the corner of the bar sits a big-bellied man with a neatly cut beard and a mug of beer in his massive hand. As he scratches the dense hair peeping out of his low-cut T-shirt, he scans a scrawny lad in the crowded adjacent room.</p>
    <p>&lsquo;This whole thing… It&rsquo;s unravelling&rsquo;. Viktor wipes sweat off his forehead, looking into the almost empty glass as if into a well. He says Tomas̈ and him have been together for almost ten years now, but they&rsquo;ve spent the last eight wondering if they should be together at all. When they met, they were both neurotic twenty-year-olds who just wanted to be loved. No matter what. And they thought it&rsquo;d be enough. That they love each other. They didn&rsquo;t imagine you need to, you know, put some effort into a relationship to make it work.</p>
    <p>David suggests it should be Tomas̈ listening to this right now and signs to Anya he wants another round. Viktor knows, he knows, but most of their conversations end up in fights.</p>
    <p>&lsquo;Piece of advice: try talking to him while you&rsquo;re sober&rsquo;.</p>
    <p>Viktor lets out an embarrassed laugh. &lsquo;That could help, actually&rsquo;.</p>
    <p>David exposes his teeth in a wide grin when Anya takes his glass to refill it. Thousands of red and black and grey hairs on his face rearrange as his skin shifts and folds. He lights a cigarette, inhales smoke and lets out two grey clouds through his nose. They form a halo around his head.</p>
    <p>Viktor plays with a lighter for a moment, sparks reflecting in his dark irises, then says Tomas̈ just makes him feel like he is some parasite.</p>
    <p>Okay, David&rsquo;s drunk, so he may regret what he&rsquo;s about to say, but it&rsquo;s not Tomas̈ or Yoanna drinking their fifth beer tonight, is it? &lsquo;Cheers&rsquo;.</p>
    <p>He looks at his vibrating phone and says he sometimes thinks she&rsquo;s psychic. The screen flashes, showing a photo of a woman in her thirties with blond curls surrounding a blue-eyed, thoughtful face. Or maybe she&rsquo;s just placed a bug inside it; he&rsquo;ll call her later. He puts the phone back on the counter.</p>
    <p>&lsquo;So she&rsquo;s quitting freelancing?&rsquo; asks Viktor, to which David replies she&rsquo;s just looking around, she&rsquo;s tired, the last client&rsquo;s been a nightmare. He hopes this thing with S.E.R.C.E. works out, &rsquo;cause she could really use some rest.</p>
    <p>I skip another hour and watch them leave the dark pub. The lights forming a wreath around the entrance are already off, the pale glow of street lamps reflecting in the dirty snow, the air growing colder by the minute. The wind is gone.</p>
    <p>I hover above the district of Vronigrad, once a separate town and now merely a modest addition to the city centre, squeezed into a meander of the river Vilga, with narrow streets and high tenement houses, flashy shop signs and a network of tramlines and overhead wires. It starts to snow. The fine flakes thread their way through the freezing air to fall onto roofs, trees and tram stops or end up inside the smoking, soot-filled maws of chimneys. I scan all the buildings like an X-ray, exposing students throwing parties, mothers and fathers trying to put their children to sleep, couples having sex, people of all ages drinking beer and wine and vodka in front of TVs and laptops. There&rsquo;s a narrow white park by the river. In the shade of its trees I can sense a movement.</p>
    <p>And there they are, David and Viktor, loud and laughing and struggling to walk straight. They turn back and wave at Anya, who locks the pub&rsquo;s front door, waves back at them and wanders off towards Teslavska Street. They go the opposite way. Round the corner Viktor stops and unzips his fly. A warm, unsteady stream crashes against the wall and flows down onto the compressed snow in a cloud of spray and vapour. He finishes, and they keep going.</p>
    <p>They enter Parkova Street, enclosed on both sides by long modernist buildings. Rows of identical windows hide the dark interiors of offices, crammed with desks and photocopiers. On the left, the cuboid buildings stretch to the very end of the street, where the park begins, but on the opposite side they eventually give way to a few shabby tenements. White and completely still, the narrow park separates the blind street from the river, whose waters glitter in the artificial light of lampposts.</p>
    <p>I have seen her all this time, but it must be only now that David and Viktor&rsquo;s eyes recognise a vague distant shape on the pavement. They grow silent and slow down. I can hear the tiny muscles inside their eyeballs stretch while trying to find focus. David breaks into a run; Viktor follows him.</p>
    <p>I remember this feeling all too well. This helplessness that starts somewhere around your heart and sweeps across your body in a series of waves, again and again, to the tips of your fingers and toes. The kind that makes you want to vomit and makes you feel like you&rsquo;re going to fall and forces you to take any, even the most desperate action, even though you start to realise nothing can be done.</p>
    <p>Yoanna&rsquo;s body lies still and silent in front of one of the tenement houses. Surrounded by a nimbus of dyed blond hair, her open-mouthed face is now a graveyard for snowflakes. At the parting, dividing her head into near-perfect halves, dark roots are showing. If you drew a line to extend the parting, it would cut between the wide-open, unbearably blue eyes, run right through the middle of the small nose and fall into the gaping mouth, which is frozen in an attempt to catch breath. Covered by layers of navy-blue and black and grey fabric, Yoanna&rsquo;s limbs are twisted in a bizarre position.</p>
    <p>David stops and his hulk of a body collapses. As his knees hit the ground, a slight shake spreads through the pavement and buildings. For a second, he moves his hands chaotically above the corpse, not knowing what to do, until he finally bends over the open, unmoving mouth to fill Yoanna&rsquo;s dead lungs with his alcohol-soaked breaths. Then he starts massaging her still heart. For all this time, Viktor stands motionless a few metres away, his arms raised half-way up, his eyes fixed in a blank stare.</p>
    <p>Hidden behind a beech trunk on the edge of the park, there is a man watching them. Tall and hefty, with an aquiline nose, broad neck and neatly trimmed blond hair, he clings to the smooth bark. His breathing is fast, his hands shaking.</p>
    <p>I take a dive through his clothes to reach the body I once knew so well. In a cascade of dense sparks, I move over the belly and the ribcage, only to take a detour at the clavicle and enter the soft tunnel of the sleeve of his jacket. His skin smells of memories &mdash; his skin is home.</p>
    <p>From where the man stands, I can clearly see how David eventually surrenders and goes into spasmodic weeping. His hands sink deep into Yoanna&rsquo;s curly blond hair when he lifts her head to touch it with his forehead. The snow grows denser.</p>
    <p>Viktor finally wakes up from the stupor and looks to the left, where his gaze meets the gaze of the hiding man. He launches into a chase.</p>
    <div class="text-separator"></div>
    <p>They run. At once, the air starts to move. I become this sudden wind, in all its piercing threads, and follow them down a shadowy path cutting through the park. The snow thickens by the second; lampposts, hidden in branches, give off a bluish glow while benches and rubbish bins become covered with microscopically thin layers of ice. The river sparkles with reflected light.</p>
    <p>Viktor&rsquo;s breathing grows heavy; he starts to slow down. The man, on the other hand, keeps a steady pace. Muscles on his body pulsate in an unchanging rhythm, his ribcage expanding in regular breaths, veins on his temples throbbing wildly. They run.</p>
    <p>A jet of sparks shoots from a long-unused phone booth at the side of the path, just as Viktor gets past it. He doesn&rsquo;t react &mdash; I must be the only one seeing these sparks &mdash; still chasing the man instead, who&rsquo;s now a good twenty meters ahead of him. From the plastic booth covered with black and grey graffiti a dog comes out.</p>
    <p>The tall pointer walks onto the path, sniffing the snow. She &mdash; because it&rsquo;s a she, her womb carrying four puppy embryos &mdash; doesn&rsquo;t seem homeless: her coat is silver and shiny and there&rsquo;s a collar studded with pulsating red diodes around her neck. I encircle the dog from above like a flock of buzzards; her skin sparkles as I move closer. The animal looks up, as if sensing me.</p>
    <p>They run, so I leave the dog and get back to them. Viktor slips on the ice-glazed surface, falling on all fours, but quickly gets up and keeps running.</p>
    <p>Down a steep descent, they run to the boulevard. The river looks like tar sprinkled with chips of glass. Viktor&rsquo;s already wheezing, sweat dripping down his forehead and cheeks and soaking his thin beard. The fleeing man, however, doesn&rsquo;t slow down. Dilated vessels paint his skin red.</p>
    <p>Viktor starts to gain speed. In disbelief, the man turns his head, hearing the ever-faster steps behind him. His eyes, grey in this dark, open wider as Viktor takes a leap and, equally surprised, lands on the man&rsquo;s back. His face smacks against a thin layer of fresh snow as Viktor&rsquo;s sweaty, heavy-breathing body pins him to the ground.</p>
    <p>Amazed at his achievement, Viktor seems clueless about what to do next. They tussle for a moment, but then they stop and just lie there against the background of the dark river for a few seconds, Viktor&rsquo;s fists clenched onto the stranger&rsquo;s black down jacket, one body flat atop the other so that through the layers of fabric they must feel each other&rsquo;s diaphragms move. Snowflakes stick to the man&rsquo;s lashes as he turns his head and eyes Viktor in a moment of strange recognition.</p>
    <p>Suddenly, the man turns over, throwing Viktor&rsquo;s listless body to the side, and places his hands on his chest. First there&rsquo;s just a short, pale flicker. Then from underneath the man&rsquo;s palms comes a series of brighter flashes. Finally, a blinding yellow light engulfs the entire scene, lying flat on the boulevard, on the river, on the floodbank made of stone. Next, a ball of luminous energy&mdash;</p>
    <p class="block-quote">And now let us bow respectfully before Jupiter, the giant of the worlds, King of the Solar System, the great comet-catcher.</p>
    <p>What&rsquo;s just happened? I didn&rsquo;t intend to say that. Must be some glitch in the narrative. Where the hell did it come from? You might not know it yet, frankly, I&rsquo;ve just learnt it myself, but when it comes to story-telling, I&rsquo;m a perfectionist. All in all, it&rsquo;s the only vital function I have left. Let&rsquo;s give it another go.</p>
    <p>I come back in time. They run down the steep descent to the boulevard, to the darkness, to the river (its black waters look as if they are covered with small diamonds), to the ice-cold wind. Viktor&rsquo;s already wheezing, but the man doesn&rsquo;t seem to be slowing down. Little vessels under his skin dilate, flooding it with redness.</p>
    <p>All at once, Viktor gains speed, much to his own surprise. On hearing the ever-faster steps, the fleeing man turns his head. His colourless eyes open wider as Viktor leaps forwards and, catching flakes of snow as he flies, lands on the man&rsquo;s back and pins him to the ground.</p>
    <p>They scuffle for a moment, but then they stop and just lie there one atop the other, layers of their clothes like geological strata. The man squints at the panting Viktor over his shoulder, then looks away and freezes for a second or two, as if deciding on what to do next. With a sudden lurch, he turns over, throwing Viktor&rsquo;s heavy-breathing body to the side, and places his hands on his chest.</p>
    <p>There&rsquo;s a series of flashes, then another, and, in a split second, a blinding glare swallows the entire scene, with the boulevard, the floodbank, the glittery river, with the silent park. A luminous sphere of energy pops into existence underneath the man&rsquo;s hands, a crown of bright rays coming&mdash;</p>
    <p class="block-quote">If Jupiter were cut up into one thousand three hundred pieces, each would be larger than the Earth. All the planets together do not weigh half as much as Jupiter. Only the Sun surpasses Jupiter in size. Jupiter, bright silver, Jupiter, thirty-seven silver dollars, a boy of fourteen got his first glimpse of the satellites of Jupiter.</p>
    <p>Not again. Must be some temporary bug. But why does it keep happening exactly at the same moment? As if this bastard of an event just doesn&rsquo;t want to be told properly. Perhaps it&rsquo;s only a coincidence. Let&rsquo;s do this the right way.</p>
    <p>I come back in time and there they are, running down the slippery slope to the boulevard, their skin flushed, their lungs catching the freezing air, their hearts pumping blood in a frenetic rhythm. The river is blackness covered with glitter.</p>
    <p>All of a sudden, Viktor starts to gain speed. Whatever force has made him do so, it also propels him up in the air, moving over a parabolic path and down onto the running man&rsquo;s back. Having struggled for a moment, they cease and just lie there against the dark, sparkling background. The man looks at Viktor as if realising something.</p>
    <p>He turns over, throwing the startled Viktor off to the side, and quickly puts his hands on his moving ribs. There&rsquo;s a flicker, there&rsquo;s a flash. Next, the whole landscape disappears in a retina-burning gleam, and&mdash;</p>
    <p class="block-quote">This splendid globe rotates upon himself with prodigious rapidity. He accomplishes his diurnal revolution in less than ten hours. At aphelion let us wander well out towards the path of Jupiter. Let us succumb to his gravitative action.</p>
    <p>Shit.</p>
    <p>Breathe slowly, there must be a way around it. How is that possible, that one minute the narrative just flows, every noun and adjective and verb falling into places, and then, all of a sudden, I start spewing out this nonsense? There must be an explanation. You should know that when I was still alive, I was a bit of a control freak (you&rsquo;ve probably figured this out yourself) and even now, in death, I fucking hate it when things are beyond my control. Easy. Take a deep breath. Just count to ten. One… Two… Three… Four… Five… Six… Seven… Eight…</p>
    <p>Okay, that&rsquo;s it.</p>
    <p>I come back in fucking time. They run down to the boulevard, Viktor sweats like a pig, he starts to run faster, jumps on the bloke, they tussle a bit and then the chap&mdash;</p>
    <p class="block-quote">The giant of the worlds, King of the Solar System, the great comet-catcher.</p>
    <p class="no-indent">&mdash;shoots a bloody ball of light and Viktor passes the fuck out. The End.</p>
