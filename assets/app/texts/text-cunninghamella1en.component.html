    <p id="first">Cyphomandra crassicaulis<i>, tamarillo, sometimes called the tree tomato, is a small tree or shrub in the flowering plant family </i>Solanaceae <i>(the nightshade family); two varieties of tree tomatoes are widely commercialised, one being golden orange with yellowish flesh, and the other burgundy or purple with orange-coloured flesh.</i></p>

    <p>She dreamed she was inside of a piano and couldn&rsquo;t get out.</p>
    <p>A day off. She woke up before her alarm and was like, &lsquo;Hello, world!&rsquo; Then she went to take a shower. The streams of hot water massaging her scalp and soothing her muscles, she relaxed and breathed. Looking at granite tiles and cracked grout with her tired, forty-year-old eyes, she thought about Luul, who believes lively colours are good for children and applies this philosophy in the colour palette of her bathroom. (In Chinese culture the colour red is closely associated with good fortune and happiness, so it&rsquo;s good to have it.)</p>
    <p>After the shower, time for a cup of coffee: topped with a swirl of foam, its shape resembling Antarctica, then the Milky Way. Joenaur was still asleep. She thought she&rsquo;d have to wake him soon.</p>
    <p>After breakfast (if you like a lot of chocolate on your biscuit, join our club) she went to her room and flopped down on the bed, face in the pillow. Pressive pain under skull as though the skull were pressed outwards with a sharp peg.</p>
    <p>The floor squeaked behind the wall. Now sitting on the soft edge of the bed, Ellery leaned forwards so that she could see the entrance hall (stylish & highly functional). The door opened and Joenaur walked out into the hall. She looked at his dark hair and his muscular arms from his obsession with working out.</p>
    <p>She loved his smiles, his jokes, the way he brushed her hair aside and kissed her forehead as if her skin were no more than silken wrapping paper protecting a treasured gift. He walked towards Ellery, smiled, stretched and yawned, then leaned over her, and kissed her forehead. It was a strange and heartening sight.</p>
    <p>&lsquo;Will you make me some coffee?&rsquo; he asked.</p>

    <p>Great coffee starts with great beans. The quality and flavour of your coffee is not only determined by your favourite brewing process, but also by the type of coffee you select. The water you use is very important to the quality of your coffee. Use filtered or bottled water if your tap water is not good or has a strong odour or taste, such as chlorine.</p>
    <p>Ellery was sitting on a stool in the kitchen, reading the label on a bag of coffee. <i>(If you are a lover of good quality Coffee, then you will love what we have up for grabs in our competition.

    <p>Coffee&rsquo;s ready.</p>
    <div class="text-separator"></div>
    <p>Proper chips should be thick cut and defiantly potatoey: golden to the eye, hot and fluffy within. As fat sizzled away in the pan, its pleasant smell mingled with the already present scent of coffee and Ellery smiled to herself. She loved moments like these.</p>
    <p>They sat in Ellery&rsquo;s bedroom in front of the TV, eating chips and cheap, beautiful hamburgers. (Do not tell your cardiologist about this.) A programme about an alcoholic was on. It showed the plight that the drinker was going through, the constant battle with the bottle, but more than anything it showed the utter anguish the alcoholic&rsquo;s family were going through. Then the news started.</p>
    <p>Live coverage from floor 1901. A swarm of police officers surrounding a door, which gushed luxurious vegetation out into the corridor. The plants&rsquo; branches, covered with vividly green leaves, bent under the weight of burgundy or purple fruit with orange-coloured flesh. Against this colourful background, a young, exquisitely dressed woman was covering the events of the previous night. The reporter said the plant was identified as <i>Cyphomandra crassicaulis</i>, tamarillo, sometimes called the tree tomato. (<i>The tree tomato can be eaten raw when it is very ripe</i>, Ellery recalled.<i> Simply cut it in half and sprinkle it with a little sugar or salt, or with lime or lemon juice. It can also be puréed and used to flavour yoghurt, ice cream, sorbets, and cocktails. Unripe, it is often cooked like a vegetable. When cooked with other fruits, it should be used in moderation, as its flavour can be overpowering.</i>) The flat was home to a couple of elderly ladies, one of whom was bed-ridden due to a fracture in her spine caused by osteoporosis. She was the one who fell victim to the murderous plants.</p>
    <p>&lsquo;Preliminary findings suggest&rsquo;, the reporter continued, &lsquo;that the tree tomato grew inside the victim&rsquo;s body, ripping it to shreds, and then started growing in an uncontrolled and uncoordinated fashion, filling the entire flat in an instant&rsquo;.</p>
    <p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s terrible&rsquo;, Ellery reacted.</p>
    <p>&lsquo;I never liked tomatoes&rsquo;, Joenaur confessed.</p>
    <div class="text-separator"></div>
    <p>Being physically active is important to prevent heart disease and stroke, the nation&rsquo;s No. 1 and No. 5 killers. With this very thing in mind, Ellery and Joenaur took a lift to floor 2001 (40W T12 fluorescent tubes, people entering and leaving).</p>
    <p>There were no flats on this floor, its entire area occupied by an enormous strolling hall: a floor of marble pammets, complemented with oak veneer, benches and potted orange trees, people strolling lazily, a plethora of windows surrounding the entire place, with fog and outlines of blocks of flats (and fog) outside the windows, butterflies fluttering under the ceiling.</p>
    <p>They strolled for a bit, then found a park bench to relax on for a while, but soon got up and started strolling again, as if contemplating the slow flow of time. She wanted to get back to their recent conversation, but didn&rsquo;t want another quarrel, not when her stomach was already tied in a knot, so she just glanced at the orange trees as they walked gloomily through a deathly-grey twilight, gloomily and sternly with compressed lips.</p>
    <p>Finally, Joenaur said he was getting tired and suggested they went back home. Reluctantly, Ellery agreed and they were already heading for the lift when, all of a sudden, a familiar figure emerged from among the trees.</p>
    <p>Peetu worked in the same call centre as Ellery. He was handsome in a predatory way, with a hulking frame and icy eyes. Whenever he was around, she felt like prey, exposed and vulnerable. Things were polite and non-engaging, just some small talk, and away they went.</p>
    <div class="text-separator"></div>
    <p>At night she dreamed of <i>Cyphomandra crassicaulis</i> shoots, germinating in the lungs, cutting the tissue.</p>
