    <p id="first">One was orange, one purple, and one pink.</p>
    <p>Stauromedusae, I looked up their name in Wikipedia, clung to the windowsill, attached to it with their stalks, they had translucent little bodies shining in the bluish light from the window, goblet-shaped, upside-down umbrellas with deep notches, spherical groups of tentacles at the edges, when I touched their springy bodies, they instantly shrunk.</p>
    <p><i>Yesterday was dramatic, today is OK</i>, I hummed inside my head, I was in the study, surrounded by orange wallpaper covered in white vertical stripes, and between the stripes there swam finely painted siphonophores and jellyfish, the carpeting was dark orange, the furniture black, I was sitting opposite the window, in front of a black desk, a laptop on top of the desk, the small stauromedusae were still on the windowsill, I thought I should eat some breakfast before getting down to work, I couldn&rsquo;t even remember the topic of the article I was supposed to write.</p>
    <p>I went to the kitchen, the kitchen was right next to the study, lined with red wallpaper in small black diamonds, black cabinets were hanging opposite the door, under the cabinets there was a worktop, a sink, a cooker, I took a loaf of whole grain bread out of the breadbox, one needs to stay healthy, and cut off two slices, placed a shred of lettuce on top of each, some cottage cheese, a few small shrimps, sprinkled it all with olive oil.</p>
    <p>A cup of tea, as always green, you need to rinse out toxins deposited in the guts, I sat at the black table in the corner next to the study door and looked at the window, the pane was cloudy as usual, two vertical fluorescent tubes were lit behind it, what can Staszek be doing at the moment, where can he be, after a second, I thought about something else.</p>
    <p>Only crumbs were left on the plate, down to the sink with the plate, then up on the drying rack, the study door was behind me, I heard my laptop&rsquo;s fan working, it would be good to get down to writing, but maybe a bath first.</p>
    <p>From the kitchen I walked to the bedroom, a large beige interior, beige wallpaper in light orange stripes and a pattern on top of them, portholes of a bathyscaphe, a bed in the opposite corner, I hated this wallpaper, cold light of windows, a sound system, floor speakers, a wardrobe full of clothes behind the corner, I remembered when, drenched in tears, I had gone to sleep in my flat in the Rataje district and woken up in this bedroom, I remembered it had been cold, everything as if behind a layer of mist, from the bedroom I had walked to the library, from the library to the entrance hall, next to the study, the kitchen and back to the bedroom, it didn&rsquo;t frighten me then, I finally felt safe, and while standing like that in the bedroom and reminiscing, I realised it had been almost two years since I&rsquo;d started living in this red house.</p>
    <p>I walked into the bathroom, the bathroom was adjacent to the kitchen, I should get down to the article, but first a bath, on pink tiles, in places, white cephalopods and jellyfish were painted, behind a cloudy window pane one could see two fluorescent tubes, I poured some water, some sea salt, the water foamed at the edges of the tub.</p>
    <p>After the bath I got back to the bedroom, checked if there was anything in the mail cabinet, my favourite piece of furniture, which, through a system of pipes, collected mail that was addressed to me, a carton of cigarettes came, super-lights of course, from the bedroom I went to the library.</p>
    <p>The library was L-shaped and inside it there were four black shelves, full of books and high up to the ceiling, there were windows, there was wallpaper in red horizontal stripes, and between the stripes red algae and eels, I walked through the library, at its end there was an entrance to the storeroom, took out a packet of cigarettes and put the remaining ones on a shelf in the storeroom, through the entrance hall painted in white and pink horizontal stripes I came back to the study.</p>
    <p>While writing the article, I listened to various songs, at times I walked out into the staircase for a cigarette, it was the best place to have a cigarette as the smoke was sucked up the staircase as if through a chimney, soft orange carpeting, some composite of its smell made me calm, beige wallpaper with seaweed and cuttlefish, winding stairs, its handrail wrapped in orange Christmas lights, a painting on the wall, a red pentagon on a white background, I managed to finish the article by five.</p>
    <p>It was time for dinner, I made myself some pasta with spinach and pine nuts, after dinner it was time for a cigarette, I went out into the staircase, once again the soft carpeting, once again the lights, I got lost in thought, the cigarette burnt my mouth, it was time to put it out.</p>
    <p>I went down the winding stairs, sometimes I liked to stroll around the other floors, on the floor below, in the staircase, there was an identical room with orange carpeting, behind the door was an identical entrance hall in pink stripes, but without my shoes and coats, from the hall I went to an L-shaped library, empty bookshelves, went to an unoccupied beige bedroom, and then through an empty kitchen and an empty study back to the entrance hall.</p>
    <p>Since I&rsquo;d woken up those two years ago in my bedroom, I had wondered how many identical floors there were in this house, whether the floors ended at any point and whether any of them were occupied.</p>
    <p>In the evening I logged into a sex chat room as wet_fanny, looked through images of webcams, my favourite one was fucker81, he was there every night, you could see him from neck to knees, he had a nice dick, that guy reminded me a little of Staszek, but was a tad stouter, fluorescent tubes behind window panes went out one after another.</p>
    <p>At night I played with my pussy, thinking of him.</p>

    <div class="text-separator"></div>

    <p>When I still lived in Poznań, I was afraid to walk the streets at night, but in this house composed of an infinite number of identical floors it was always safe, in the evenings fluorescent tubes in windows turned off by themselves, so I could get enough sleep and work efficiently throughout the day.</p>
    <p>I was working on an article about Portuguese wines, had to finish it by five, I wondered whether I was going to make it, because the text was still at a nascent stage, I remembered various excerpts of my life with Staszek, taking a dirty lift to his flat, our meetings at a café, meetings at a pub, sitting together and studying for exams, I remembered trams and buses.</p>
    <p>I also thought about my first meeting with Przemek, he had lived in the same block of flats as Staszek did, only several floors below, when I saw his red hair, broad shoulders, previously unknown substances started to release into my blood, that was the impression I had, something deep inside my head made me unable to tear my eyes away from his strong wrists, taut stomach, the line of his shoulders, I wondered for a long time afterwards whether Staszek had noticed my reaction.</p>
    <p>Having grown tired of work, I left the desk and sat in the armchair for a moment, I looked at myself from the opposite end of the room, in greyscale, the monochromatic me in a soft black armchair, and behind me a dark grey background in a white pattern: vertical stripes with finely painted siphonophores and jellyfish swimming between them.</p>
    <p>I wanted something, didn&rsquo;t know what, but for sure it wasn&rsquo;t writing the article, I thought it might be nicotine hunger, though at that time I was still convincing myself I was not an addict, so I walked out into the staircase, the soft orange carpeting, the red pentagon on a white background, in the middle of the cigarette I realised it wasn&rsquo;t the thing I was missing.</p>
    <p>So I went to the library, cold fluorescent tubes behind opaque panes, I took some book, read some sentences, put it back right away, walked to the beige bedroom, in the bedroom the air was always strangely warm, I sat in the armchair, floor speakers touching the ceiling, I pressed a button on the remote, music seeped from the speakers, <i>carry my joy on the left, carry my pain on the right, </i>were the song&rsquo;s words, I listened to it for some time and turned off the sound system, maybe I needed something else, perhaps I should get back to writing after all.</p>
    <p>I walked around the bedroom a little, then around the library, finally I went out into the staircase.</p>
    <p>Up the stairs, surrounded by Christmas lights entwined around the handrail, I travelled up through some four floors, each had the same carpeting, the same wallpaper, the same rooms behind the doors, though lacking all my rubbish, the wardrobes weren&rsquo;t filled with clothes, books weren&rsquo;t lying heavy on the bookshelves.</p>
    <p>I often thought that maybe I should pack everything most essential into two suitcases and move to some unoccupied floor, but I always came to the conclusion it would only take me a couple of months to create a similar mess there, well, the second law of thermodynamics in action, I walked down to my floor, got back to work.</p>
    <p>I sent the article with a slight delay, I was hungry, I was tired, it was time for some dinner, mussels in white wine with potato chips, the cooking magazine I worked for sent me lots of freebies, the only benefit of this work, then I surfed the Web for a long time and read about cnidarians, about different groups of cnidarians: scyphozoans, hydrozoans, cubozoans and anthozoans.</p>
    <p>When I got bored, I turned on the chat room, fucker81 was, as usual, logged on, he was playing with his cock, I dared to type some words, he wrote back after a while, <i>how old are you, what do you like, describe yourself</i> and so on, then he wrote what he was going to do to me and where he was going to put it, he masturbated while doing so, I wrote I would suck him, the fluorescent tubes in the windows started turning off one after another, finally he asked if I had a cam, <i>I do</i>, I answered, he asked if I could turn it on, <i>I can</i>, I wrote, <i>but maybe not today</i>, and that I had to go but would be happy to meet tomorrow and chat about dirty things.</p>
    <p>I turned off the black-and-white webcam window.</p>
    <p>Then it was time for supper, I made myself some seafood salad and spent the rest of the evening in front of the computer, reading stories about cnidarians, about soft animals living in the sea, the free-floating and the sedentary ones, and about the most dangerous of all, enormous jellyfish <i>Rhizostoma pulmo</i>.</p>

    <div class="text-separator"></div>

    <p>In the morning I checked the mail cabinet, nothing inside, and entered the library.</p>
    <p>The air was kind of weird, pinkish, it took me some time to realise the space of the library was densely intertwined with neon-like threads that emitted pink light, they were extremely fine threads of hydrozoan colonies, full of small living polyps with microscopic tentacles, the threads broke with the faintest movement and when I breathed in, they permeated deep into the lungs.</p>
    <p>I thought about Staszek, about the time when nightmares woke him up in the middle of the night, and he said some incoherent things, something about doom, and then he cuddled up to me and cried for a long time, and I had no idea how to help him, I wanted to drag him to a psychologist, but he didn&rsquo;t want to go, it wasn&rsquo;t long after he&rsquo;d met Przemek on some forum.</p>
    <p>I remembered when I&rsquo;d slept at Staszek&rsquo;s place, on the top floor of a tower block, through the window you could see blocks of flats in Victory Estate, a handful of windows were still lit, a panorama of the city, white clouds against a black sky, the moon, Staszek had fallen asleep before me, he was sleeping by my side, finally I fell asleep as well, dreamt of a black sea filled with jellyfish, I woke up when I heard a door slam.</p>
    <p>Staszek wasn&rsquo;t there, he must have sneaked out, I went to look for him in the small room, from the small room you could also see Victory Estate and the panorama of the city, I looked inside the kitchen, a table, a loud Soviet refrigerator, I looked inside the bathroom.</p>
    <p>I couldn&rsquo;t find him anywhere, it made me worried, I thought that maybe he&rsquo;d had another nightmare, that maybe he was sleepwalking again, so I dressed up warmly, winter was coming, perhaps it was December or some other lousy month, and went out into a dark corridor.</p>
    <p>Moonlight, I walked to the lifts, one of them arrived right away, I got out on the ground floor and after a while I was already in the parking lot outside the block of flats, it was freezing, naked tree branches, a tram terminus, it was not long before we broke up and I, drenched in tears, fell asleep in my flat in Rataje and woke in the house built of countless floors.</p>
    <p>I reached the pavement and saw Staszek, some two hundred meters away from the block of flats, by the bus stop, he was wearing a warm red jacket, he was approaching the roundabout, I wondered whether I should call out, Castorama, street lights, no one in the street, a few last windows lit in blocks of flats, I decided to follow him.</p>
    <p>He crossed through the roundabout, luckily there were no cars, he passed an off-licence and disappeared somewhere in Under the Lime Trees Estate, I didn&rsquo;t know what to think of it, I went back home, Staszek came back after an hour or so.</p>
    <p>Cigarettes, writing paragraph after paragraph, something to eat, a quick bath, hours passed, and I thought about the upcoming evening more and more often, I wondered whether I wouldn&rsquo;t chicken out, whether I&rsquo;d really log into the chat room, and whether fucker81 would be there, I was writing about squid in Mediterranean cuisine, a real uphill struggle, had to finish it by five, I realised that for the whole time I had lived here I&rsquo;d only explored maybe ten floors above me and ten floors below me, and maybe those floors ended at some point, and maybe one of them was, after all, occupied, or perhaps they formed something in the shape of a loop, and if I travelled across, say, fifty or one hundred floors, I would find myself back in my flat.</p>
    <p>Ah well, I couldn&rsquo;t focus, time for a cigarette, then for some music, I couldn&rsquo;t find anything that suited me, went to the library and read a couple of lines from <i>Undressing to Sleep</i>, after a minute I came back to the study, to the computer, to the squid.</p>
    <p>In the evening I adjusted the position of the chair and the cam, double-checked if I could be seen only from neck to knees, and logged into the chat room.</p>
    <p>Fucker81 was waiting for me, he started the talking, asked me why I was wearing clothes, I replied it could change in a second, we typed about fucking and doing different things to one another, fucker81 naked from the beginning and I, wet_fanny, more and more naked, when after some two hours we got bored, for the first time I paid attention to the background of the image from his cam.</p>
    <p>Dark grey background with a white pattern: vertical stripes with finely painted siphonophores and jellyfish swimming between them, identical wallpaper to that in my place, only in greyscale, I wanted to ask about it, but fucker81 said he had to get going, sent me kisses and logged off.</p>
    <p>At night, coming from the floor above, I heard some rustling, some crackling.</p>
