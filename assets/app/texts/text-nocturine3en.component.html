<div class="story nocturine">
    <p id="first">There was a bakery, a mill, a barn, a granary, beneath which there was a larder, the larder was bottomless, it was a shaft stretching endlessly into the ground, there was also a small house on the side, there was an orchard, there were fields all around, a track ran through the fields, the track led to a bridge over a black river, a black forest stretched beyond the bridge.</p>
    <p>I was sitting in the bakery, feeling like a little girl again, upstairs, on the floor, white walls dirty with soot from oil lamps, it was midday, there was a window in front of me, through which I could see the mill, there were doors on both sides of the window: the left one to the kitchen, the right one to a bedroom with an abandoned double bed, next to me, to the left, there were stairs leading to the ground floor, behind me wooden stairs leading to the attic, next to which, also to the left, there was the entrance to the room where I slept.</p>
    <p>I thought about Przemek, since I&rsquo;d woken in this strange homestead, I&rsquo;d thought he would maybe come for me and save me, more and more often I dreamt of dummies, I knew they&rsquo;d finally come and get me, that&rsquo;s why I wouldn&rsquo;t be parted even for a moment from a broom with a long wooden handle, to have something to defend myself with.</p>
    <p>I went to my room, looked through the windows at the track, the field stretched behind the track, grey rye was waving in it, it was autumn, so it should&rsquo;ve been harvested a long time ago, there was some lingering mist in the rye, for the morning was misty, I went back to the corridor, went down the stairs to the dark vestibule, the only light fell through small panes above the door, I should light an oil lamp, suddenly I saw that on the mirror, with black, still-running ink, someone had written a rhyme, a dummy had written a rhyme:</p>

    <p class="block-quote">hush hush little ones<br>for the game just starts<br>mill has sighed<br>barn has cried<br>Legless is gonna get your hide</p>

    <p>At the same moment I heard a whirr of plastic wheels upstairs, I knew it was the dummy Legless, who&rsquo;d come to kill me, not thinking much, I went outside.</p>
    <p>The sky was a deep mauve, there was still a little mist in it, the sun hid in this mist, then black clouds covered the sky, and the mist vanished from the sky in an instant, and in the courtyard it hid in corners, so that only a little greyness was still showing in places, I looked at the field and at the trees, the trees didn&rsquo;t move an inch, just as if that wind which was moving the clouds was only high up above the ground and impossible to reach.</p>
    <p>I took a few steps deeper into the courtyard, the orchard was motionless, the trees in the orchard were naked, the houses also didn&rsquo;t move an inch, only the fields were moving a little, the ones that were all around, except for the track running through them in front of the bakery and the mill, but except for that they were all around, stretching right to the river, right to the forest, which was black, and the sky was glooming with darkness.</p>
    <p>I took some more steps and kept taking those steps, walking past the granary and behind the barn, because I wanted to walk out behind the barn, and there I saw scrap metal on the ground, as if carried around the place by wind, and that scrap metal was sinking a little into the field, the crops were grey and the sky getting darker and darker, everything looked as if it were flooded with plum compote, as if the bakery might be crushed by a gigantic plum any minute, or the mill be crushed, I looked at the double door, because the barn, on both sides, from the field and from the courtyard, had double doors, I wanted to check if there was someone inside, but feared there might be someone inside, so I got back.</p>
    <p>I thought about the day when I had felt faint during classes and wanted to walk out of the lecture hall, and when I&rsquo;d almost reached the door, my legs collapsed under my weight, I saw the frightened face of the lecturer and the ever-closer floor, when I opened my eyes, I saw a ceiling dirty with soot, I was lying on a bed, there was a wardrobe against the wall, there was a table, windows overlooking the fields, you could see a huge elm on the other side of the track.</p>
    <p>I froze when I went past the corner, because from the barn door, but the one at the top, right beneath the roof, a ladder had come out, it must have come out when I was round the corner, looking at the double door and looking at the fields, at the river and the forest, the bridge over the river, a ladder had come out and fallen to the ground, so now one of its ends was resting on the ground and the other on that door right beneath the roof, it must have come out very quietly, because I&rsquo;d been just round the corner and hadn&rsquo;t heard anything, I looked back, looked about the courtyard, and there was more and more of darkness, some huge shape between the clouds, so I thought for an instant it was a gigantic plum, the granary stood still, as if awaiting something.</p>
    <p>Then a clatter of plastic wheels, I looked up, and there was Legless coming down, faster and faster, I recognised her right away, I&rsquo;d seen her in my dreams, Legless kept coming towards me down the inclined plane of the ladder, and I was wondering what to do, I was completely at a loss, clouds in the sky, clouds, Legless was coming down, wearing a wig and with painted eyes, with grey plastic, she was barely moving, only going down in a fixed pose, a plastic trunk stuck onto a wheeled stand, I was completely at a loss for what to do.</p>
    <p>When she was still high above, since the ladder was long, I took the other end of the ladder and started to pull, to make it slide out of the door and thump against the ground, to make the mannequin shatter, but I had barely started pulling when I felt it was going to be hard, &rsquo;cause the ladder was heavy, but I kept pulling anyway, and the dummy came ever lower, ever closer, I kept pulling, finally the ladder slid out of the door.</p>
    <p>I watched the dummy falling, the ladder collapsing, the ladder seemed to be falling faster, since the wheels broke away from the rungs, and the dummy seemed to have gone up, but in reality they were both falling, but the dummy a tad more slowly than the ladder, while she was falling, her hands moved up a little, her eyes were still painted in the same way, the sky darker and darker, a deeper and deeper mauve, when suddenly the ladder bashed against the ground, and after a moment there was a plastic bang, and it was the dummy that fell and collapsed in a plastic rumble, and the plastic was lying there, not moving an inch.</p>
    <p>And I kept looking at that plastic that wasn&rsquo;t moving and wondered whether I&rsquo;d damaged it enough to make it stop moving forever, the plastic trunk stuck onto the wheeled stand, the painted eyes, the wig, the ground was moist and had a strong smell, clouds were moving across the sky, in two layers, one closer and the other farther away, the trees in the orchard were black, I kept looking at that plastic that wasn&rsquo;t moving, I even came closer to hear if it was breathing, but maybe plastic never breathes, even when it moves on wheels or waves its arms.</p>
    <p>And then she sprung up, a loud rattle, and Legless rose up and made a strange sound, like a pig&rsquo;s squeal, but so very silent, and I got scared and raced off, I was already round the corner, I lost the broom on the way, and in a second I was inside the barn, where it was almost completely dark, and rakes and hoes and spades were lying in a pile, because that thing at the top had broken off, that pole on which all the rakes and hoes and spades had been hanging, I heard Legless coming, I heard her approaching, I had to hide somewhere, had to hide somewhere.</p>
    <p>So I hid in this pile of rakes and hoes, crawled to the very middle, and I was somewhat like a stickleback in its nest, I could already hear Legless coming and I still hoped she would go past the door, you could barely see a thing, from the pile in which I was lying all those hoes and spades were sticking out, I was afraid I&rsquo;d start to shiver, and all those hoes and spades and maybe even scythes would also start to shake, and that it would betray me.</p>
    <p>And Legless entered, so very slowly and calmly, so extraordinarily quietly she entered, you couldn&rsquo;t even hear the wheels moving, and as soon as she entered, the shadow of the barn fell over her, and the painted eyes disappeared, and I could only see the black outline of the plastic, moving deeper and deeper into the barn, she went right past me, knocked against the holder of a hoe, then she plunged into the barn&rsquo;s clouds, because the barn had dark clouds inside, so I couldn&rsquo;t see much of Legless, only a part of the stand somewhere and maybe an arm, she wasn&rsquo;t moving and I should&rsquo;ve run away.</p>
    <p>Because she turned around on the stand at once, and her arms were still held in the same position, her head somewhat tilted, though I could only see the outline, and she was approaching me, but maybe, I thought, she just wanted to get out of the barn, and she was approaching in the same pose for the whole time, and suddenly, a little bent over the whole time, she stopped above me.</p>
    <p>She was standing above me in the darkness and she was right above my head, and I was in all those hoes and rakes and now they were truly a trap for me, &rsquo;cause I wouldn&rsquo;t manage to run away from there at all, that is as fast as I wished, &rsquo;cause Legless would get me before I freed myself, and as soon as I thought that, I started to shiver big time, Legless was standing above me motionless and this motionlessness was scarier than if she&rsquo;d done some other scary things to me, and I started shivering, and all those hoes and spades started shaking, something started to clatter, something hit against something, Legless was standing above me, she must have heard that, although maybe mannequins can&rsquo;t hear.</p>
    <p>Finally she turned around on the stand and went quickly to the other end of the barn, and there again she was standing, as if listening, and she wasn&rsquo;t moving again, and I couldn&rsquo;t take it anymore and broke free from the pile of hoes so that it exploded in all directions, and the rakes and forks and scythes plunged in all directions too, but I was already in front of the barn, in the field, running, &rsquo;cause I knew Legless would come out of the barn in a second and get me, I kept looking back, running towards the track to go around the bakery, run to the door and hide inside, so I was running towards the track, the sky darker and darker, and while I was running onto the track, I looked back for the last time.</p>
    <p>And I fell into the dummy&rsquo;s paws, Legless was already on the track, I fell into her plastic arms, and I fell there so forcefully that we both fell down in a plastic embrace and rolled over the track, wet dust rose, and I broke free right away, though I couldn&rsquo;t be sure if she really wanted to seize me, since those arms of hers were motionless all the time, but I guess she did, &rsquo;cause then she got up, I don&rsquo;t know how she did that, she got up and started chasing me quickly, much faster than I was running, and as soon as she caught up with me, she raised her plastic arm and bashed me on the head.</p>
    <p>It knocked me out, I came to after a moment and saw the dark sky and clouds in this sky and branches of the tree in the sky, and Legless also appeared against the background of this sky, and I cringed, and she bopped me with her paw so powerfully that I felt this paw deep in my back, I moaned but got up quickly and ran into the field, &rsquo;cause I hoped Legless&rsquo; wheels would become entangled in this field, and she wouldn&rsquo;t be able to chase me, but she kept chasing me anyway, dusk was falling, I thought about Przemek, the sky had become totally dark, Legless was chasing me, keeping up with me, and even moving much faster than I was, while I was wading through the crops and through the darkness, when I almost felt the dummy&rsquo;s paw on my neck and felt that nothing would help me, it was exactly then that it got silent, I looked back, Legless had disappeared and there was no one there, and only I was there, and the darkness everywhere above the fields was billowing and moving, and the distant forest standing black against the black sky, stillness all around.</p>

    <div class="text-separator"></div>

    <p>I woke up in the middle of the night, I checked right away whether the broom was still lying along my bed, it was in its place, I shivered, I wanted to think of something pleasant, of that time when Przemek had taken me to a funfair, then I thought about Staszek, who had come to Przemek&rsquo;s place one day, right after I&rsquo;d moved there, looking devastated, Przemek didn&rsquo;t want to tell me what had happened.</p>
    <p>I lifted an oil lamp from the floor, removed the lampshade, took matches and started lighting one after another, but they kept going out, finally I managed to light the wick, I replaced the lampshade, the room was filled with shades of sepia, and, to my own terror, I saw that on the wall, with black ink, someone had written the words:</p>

    <p class="block-quote">dreadful stillness in the house<br>fear is making my heart bounce<br>Eyeless taking steps and steps<br>summons clouds like spider webs<br>mill grew silent as a mouse</p>

    <p>Eyeless, I had dreamt of him as well, he was dreadful, he had a plastic head with no eyes painted on it, only hollows in plastic, he always carried an oil lamp in an extended plastic arm, I looked through the windows, it began to get light.</p>
    <p>It was grey-bluing and I went to the kitchen and looked through the windows and the sky was grey-blue and in this grey-blue sky, in this grey-blueness an enormous black cloud was hanging, its shape resembling Antarctica and its size not much smaller, if it had fallen down onto the houses, it would&rsquo;ve left a huge black pit in the ground and there would&rsquo;ve been no houses, there would&rsquo;ve been no fields, probably even a part of the forest would&rsquo;ve been missing, it was enormous and black, though obviously I couldn&rsquo;t see it from the kitchen windows, but it was hanging motionless, and I was standing in silence and I knew that something bad was going to happen and I knew that Eyeless.</p>
    <p>And then a light appeared behind the window, a pale glow moving higher and higher, I knew it was Eyeless, eventually it grew completely light from a lamp, and I saw the dummy&rsquo;s head, and this head was moving upwards, dragging the dummy behind, so the dummy was emerging slowly, so that he was emerging and the lamp was emerging with him, as if he was standing on some kind of lift, but he couldn&rsquo;t have been standing on any lift, &rsquo;cause there was no lift, he must&rsquo;ve been moving in the air.</p>
    <p>Eyeless eyed me for a while with his hollow eye sockets, then I took the broom and ran, stormed into the corridor and I was already running down the stairs, but suddenly saw light in the vestibule, &rsquo;cause Eyeless was already in the vestibule, he had moved there somehow, so I ran back to the kitchen and I was somewhat afraid Eyeless would move back behind the window, but he wasn&rsquo;t behind the window, he was walking up the stairs, I could hear steps and see light seeping brighter and brighter through a crack and I was trapped, I had nowhere to go, because the window was too high to jump out of, and Eyeless was taking steps and everything was listening out for Eyeless, and everything froze and was awaiting Eyeless, while he was getting closer and closer.</p>
    <p>Eyeless was already upstairs, I noticed that I was trembling a lot and that the broom was shaking, I didn&rsquo;t know where I could hide, so I didn&rsquo;t even try, and Eyeless knew exactly where I was, he was taking steps and walking to me, but then I heard the bedroom door and I thought Eyeless had closed himself inside the bedroom and I looked through the keyhole, I only saw the closed door, but Eyeless could equally be standing in the corridor and that was why I couldn&rsquo;t see him.</p>
    <p>But I opened the door and he wasn&rsquo;t standing in the corridor, and high above the houses the enormous black cloud was hanging and it was the shape of a vast continent, and black rain started falling down from it.</p>
    <p>I ran through the corridor and while I was running down the stairs, the bedroom door opened, and Eyeless emerged from it with his lamp, as if pushed by a cuckoo-clock mechanism, I saw the still plastic hands and the lamp that was shining, I ran through the vestibule, bumped into the oven, &rsquo;cause downstairs there was a huge oven, and I didn&rsquo;t know which way to run, because if I ran one way, Eyeless would be there, and if I ran the other way, Eyeless would also be there and get me and do whatever he liked to me, but eventually I ran to the right, to the flour room, then to the lumber room, where I pressed myself close against the wall and looked about at all the equipment that stood still, at an old lamp, a wardrobe, a stand, a rusty Harley-Davidson, and I also stood completely still.</p>
    <p>And Eyeless walked down the stairs at once, I could clearly hear him walking, because the stairs were right behind the lumber room&rsquo;s wall, so I could hear every creak of the plastic, then I heard him next to the oven, but first I saw the light of the lamp and later I could see the shadow of the door moving more and more, and this meant that Eyeless was approaching with the lamp, closer and closer, and finally the rectangle of light stopped opposite the door, and this meant Eyeless was exactly in front of the door, but then the rectangle, thankfully, started moving further, and Eyeless moved deeper into the flour room, and the light moved along with him, and then I ran out.</p>
    <p>I ran along the oven, I wanted to turn to the vestibule, but I was running too fast and didn&rsquo;t make it and stormed into the changing room, and I could already hear the plastic thudding behind me, it was Eyeless running behind me and rumbling, and I could see the light swaying and getting closer, I could see the light chasing me, and in the changing room I knocked down a few clothes hangers as if this could possibly stop Eyeless, and then I raced through the cooling room to the vestibule and rushed outside, and outside black rain was falling and drizzling down my neck, and the black cloud was hanging in the sky and casting a gigantic shadow, and I ran across the courtyard to hide behind the granary and I was sure Eyeless would chase after me.</p>
    <p>But he didn&rsquo;t chase after me, &rsquo;cause I leaned around the corner and saw he was in the bakery, &rsquo;cause there was light in one window, and then light in another window, and the rain was dreadfully cold, &rsquo;cause that black Antarctica was liquefying, the one hanging above my head, and I looked at this black Antarctica, but from the bottom it didn&rsquo;t look like Antarctica at all.</p>
    <p>Once again I thought about Przemek, I missed his strong wrists, his breakfasts in bed, I remembered emails he had once received, they were really strange, he showed me all of them, they said that the city was going to meet its Ragnarök, that Przemek had been chosen, that he was one of the city&rsquo;s guardians, that there were also other city guardians, for instance a woman supposed to open a passage between the old city and a new one, we decided someone was making fun of him.</p>
    <p>I was hiding between the black-roofed granary, onto which the black rain from the black cloud was pouring, but it was no hiding place, because there were no hiding places for me, because Eyeless knew all my hiding places, I imagined Przemek was by my side, embracing me, and then I saw light on the barn, it was moving across the double door, it was Eyeless walking noiselessly and holding the lamp, and I could tell by the light that he was moving closer and closer.</p>
    <p>He was walking towards me, because the granary&rsquo;s shadow was moving, so I hid behind the wall facing the orchard and wondered whether I should run behind the mill or run into the orchard, but it was too far away, black rain was falling, and I hoped that maybe the mannequin wasn&rsquo;t walking to me, that he was walking behind the barn instead, and I was watching the granary&rsquo;s shadow move.</p>
    <p>And the way it was moving let me work out Eyeless was walking along the barn to its very end, where the field started, and then the shadow stopped moving, so I figured Eyeless had stopped, and I peeped round the corner, and Eyeless stood there with the lamp, at the very end of the barn, and he didn&rsquo;t move, suddenly he looked into my eyes with his no-eyes, because they were no-eyes, he looked at me and shone the lamp in my eyes, I hid around the corner, frightened.</p>
    <p>The shadow started moving, and it was moving in such a way that it betrayed that Eyeless was moving across the courtyard towards the orchard, and when the shadow had moved a certain distance, I moved behind the wall facing the field, I hoped Eyeless would cross the orchard and disappear into the field, but finally the shadow froze and this meant Eyeless had frozen as well.</p>
    <p>The clouds above me grew much thicker, but those which were high above, higher even than the cloud as black as Antarctica, it was still raining, I was already soaking wet, thought it wasn&rsquo;t raining much, and the rain was icy cold and chilled me to the marrow.</p>
    <p>Eyeless started off, you could hear his steps, he was taking them loudly on purpose, to make me more afraid, and I could see the light, and the granary&rsquo;s shadow was growing shorter and shorter, because Eyeless was getting closer and closer with his lamp, and I was holding the broom, wondering how to defend myself with that broom, and Eyeless was getting closer and closer, the shadow shorter and shorter, the steps ever louder, and I thought that maybe now he would stop, and then turn around and go away, and Eyeless seemed to have heard my wishful thought, because the light stopped moving, because the steps died down, because you couldn&rsquo;t hear a thing for a while, I even tried not to breathe.</p>
    <p>I thought about Przemek, wondered what he was doing at that moment, whether he was waiting for me or maybe he&rsquo;d already found someone else, though for the whole time I&rsquo;d been convinced that Przemek would come here to save me.</p>
    <p>He pulled me out by the collar, gripped me with his strong paw made of plastic and pulled me out, so hard that it hurt, with one plastic hand he was still holding the lamp, with the other he was pulling me by the collar, so that I started to choke, so that I let go of the broom, and he lugged me out to the middle of the courtyard, so that I was all covered in mud, so that I&rsquo;d become all cold from the ground, I wept, and he had no mercy, I couldn&rsquo;t breathe, tears were falling from my eyes, and he finally let me go, and I was lying at his feet, and he stood over me, put the lamp away and stood over me, and his standing over me was even more frightening than if he&rsquo;d done something scary to me, but he only stood there and didn&rsquo;t move an inch.</p>
    <p>And then he raised his arms, he raised both of them towards the sky, and centrally above his head there was this vast black continent, and he was holding those hands up like that, and they plasticised in the silence, they plasticised in the silence, and the black rain was falling and it was icy cold, and the falling rain grew heavier and heavier, and Eyeless stood with those hands stretched up, and those hands almost creaked out of stillness, and they plasticised, and I was lying on the ground, and the black rain was falling.</p>
    <p>Then the hands dropped, they dropped in a flash and whacked me so forcefully that for an instant I was seeing black before my eyes, but I felt like I was flying like a bullet high above the courtyard, like the air was whizzing around me, and then, when I started to see but was still flying, I saw blood pouring out of my head and I saw the black cloud in the sky.</p>
    <p>And I smashed against the barn door, and everything hurt, because I&rsquo;d sunk deep into it, I guess even some planks got broken, and then I was hanging on to this door for a while, until I finally tumbled off and slammed face first into the mud.</p>
    <p>I got up after a while, blood was flowing out of my head, every bone hurt, I couldn&rsquo;t straighten up, so I was crawling on all fours, and I couldn&rsquo;t lift my head either to see if Eyeless was standing where he had stood motionless, and blood was pouring into my eye, and my other eye was filled with mud, but I managed to crane my neck and look about the courtyard, the courtyard was empty.</p>
    <p>Then from behind the bakery&rsquo;s corner Eyeless sprung out and started to beat me with his paw, I groaned so very silently, and he kept hitting me with his plastic hand, and his strokes were so very forceful, they made me cringe in pain, then I was lying on the ground, and he kept hitting, red marks appeared on my hands, red marks appeared on my back, and then Eyeless walked away, or maybe he vanished, and I kept lying in this mud, and the black rain kept falling on me, and the mud was turning black from this rain, and then I crawled to the broom, and crawled behind the granary with the broom, and there I stayed, blood was flowing less and less, but everything hurt and it hurt even when I was breathing, and I cried, and the black rain from the icy cold black cloud was falling on me, and night was already coming on, and everything was becoming black, and I kept sitting behind the granary, and the enormous cloud as black as Antarctica merged entirely with the black sky.</p>
