<div class="story nocturine">
    <p id="first">Blood vessels were dilating, pulmonary alveoli evenly filled with air and then emptied, I was running along a tramline, the sky was still clear, while running, I could see the Merchant of Poznań department store, there were people, I could hear keys and coins jingling in my pocket.</p>
    <p>I was in a hurry to get home, the city, I thought, had been much nicer since they&rsquo;d built the new tramline, I wanted to get home before Kazik left, because he was about to leave, there were white clouds in the sky, the sky was blue, there was even some sun, Kazik was about to go to another city for a while.</p>
    <p>The Chopin Park, the pink church, I was running along the tracks, the sky was clear, in places I could see black, perfectly symmetrical cubes, at different heights, yet still much higher than tenement roofs, I thought, I remember, that it was an ad campaign for a new mobile phone company, now I laugh at this thought, that all over the city there appeared black levitating cubes, which aroused dismay, surprise, anxiety or whatever other feeling they were meant to arouse, and after two weeks it was going to become clear it was all just meant to make you buy a new phone, from a new company, with a new camera and an mp3 player.</p>
    <p>I wanted to make it to see Kazik, but first I had to give Mirka back a book I&rsquo;d borrowed from her, before she left as well, white clouds, squares against the background of white clouds, they seemed so two-dimensional from the ground, they were cubes though, before she left, because Mirka was about to leave as well, soon, I had no idea if I was going to see her again or if she was really going to leave, because there&rsquo;d been a few times when she&rsquo;d been supposed to leave but eventually hadn&rsquo;t, I thought there was fog, even though the air was clear and the sky was blue.</p>
    <p>There was no fog, that was just my thinking, but if there&rsquo;d been any, it would have tightly covered all the buildings: tenement houses, shops, and one couldn&rsquo;t see a thing, and I would have just been running in that whiteness, and that whiteness would have been cold.</p>
    <p>I was 15 minutes late, it could be worse, Mirka had been waiting for me somewhere in Garbary Street, I don&rsquo;t know why we&rsquo;d arranged to meet there exactly, maybe she liked to watch the wig shop, or perhaps there was some more important reason, as I was running, I could see the cubes at times, I was much more interested, however, in what was in front of me and what was under my feet so that I wouldn&rsquo;t trip over the bloody uneven paving.</p>
    <p>I saw Mirka from a distance, she was kind enough not to look ostentatiously at her watch, the tenement roofs were above us, there was the sky, the cubes in the sky, and I ran up to her, panting, and my eyes said I&rsquo;m sorry, but she just smiled and kissed me on the cheek, commenting on my stubble I hadn&rsquo;t had the time to shave, and we went somewhere, don&rsquo;t remember where.</p>
    <p>I remember it was some shitty café and that on its walls there were some awkwardly painted figures of actors, I&rsquo;m starting to recall what café it was, from time to time Mirka ran her fingers through her bright hair, she was wearing it loose, while usually she wore it tied up, and her eyes that day were somewhat sad.</p>
    <p>I gave her the book, and she said she wasn&rsquo;t going to leave yet, said she&rsquo;d stay a little longer in this fucking city, in this fucking country, and I thought that at that very moment the fog filled the whole café, and everyone was enveloped in it, and the waitress was groping her way around, or maybe she had a special fog suit and fog lights, Mirka kept running her fingers through her hair.</p>
    <p>I said I was in a hurry, said I wanted to make it before Kazik left, so I could stay only for an hour or so, I had already forgotten when his train was leaving.</p>
    <p>Mirka kept talking through that fog, though there was no fog, and I listened to her but at the same time thought about 8-bit games, such as <i>Boulder Dash</i>, I loved to play those 8-bit games on 8-bit computers when I was a kid and spent hours in my yellow room upstairs and used a screwdriver to adjust the head in the tape drive, and on the screen there appeared sprites that were 24 pixels wide and 21 pixels high.</p>
    <p>Mirka was sad, I wasn&rsquo;t surprised she felt that way, and though I really didn&rsquo;t want her to leave, I knew she would be better off somewhere else, after all that had happened to her, because a couple of years earlier Mirka had suffered a coma and then her boyfriend, Przemek, had vanished somewhere, but instead of talking about those sad things that still sat somewhere in her head, she talked about Björk&rsquo;s new album, that she really liked the song <i>Wanderlust</i>, I liked it as well and told her how I liked those horns, trumpets and whatever brass also played there, and the beat I suspected was a beat from an early nineties drum machine, and at the same time I thought about the cubes, I&rsquo;d even dreamt about them, but then I still thought it was all an ad campaign.</p>
    <p>In those dreams the cubes were growing, they were like the amoeba from <i>Boulder Dash</i>, because in <i>Boulder Dash</i> there was an amoeba that kept growing and growing and was composed of many square, pulsating elements, and in those dreams the cubes were growing just &lsquo;Better tell me how your novel&rsquo;s going&rsquo;like that amoeba, but in 3D, and new cubes kept appearing side by side, over and over again, although at that time all the cubes in the sky were still single.</p>
    <p>And I didn&rsquo;t believe it could be any other way, because for me they were still an ad campaign, just like when those big red hands had appeared all over the city, Mirka had thin wrists and pale palms, she was playing with a napkin, or maybe a beer mat, and said she&rsquo;d found a new job and maybe wouldn&rsquo;t leave this time, that is, it was nothing for certain, just an offer, I thought about fog that entered the ears, entered the mouth and permeated every canal inside the body.</p>
    <p>And I thought about nucleotides that, quite probably, at that moment formed pairs in many different parts of my body and, quite probably, various mutations occurred, and every such mutation could lead to malignant neoplasm, and all I could do was count on each cell&rsquo;s defence mechanism, I told Mirka it had been weird between me and Kazik lately, that we hadn&rsquo;t been having sex at all, because he&rsquo;d been working all the time, and I&rsquo;d been staying at home so unemployed and playing on a Commodore 64 emulator and sending CVs and checking my email to see if anyone&rsquo;d replied.</p>
    <p>Mirka told me to wait, to take it easy, to remember Kazik was a little reserved and that the whole situation probably blew his mind a little, though he wouldn&rsquo;t let anyone notice, and told me everything would be just fine and then started talking about some new shoes she&rsquo;d spotted in a window but couldn&rsquo;t afford.</p>
    <p>And then she said something about <i>Naked Lunch</i>, I&rsquo;d read that book, but when I read it, my mind kept drifting away, because it was when I suspected Kazik was having an affair, even though he probably wasn&rsquo;t, only neurotransmitters inside my brain, as usual, failed to work the way they should, so I don&rsquo;t remember much from the book, later on Mirka said something about a guy she&rsquo;d met, but after all she&rsquo;d been through, she somehow wasn&rsquo;t that keen on being with anyone or maybe she just couldn&rsquo;t.</p>
    <p>The book I gave her back was <i>Axing </i>by Stachura, actually I&rsquo;d read only small fragments of it, because lately, somehow, I hadn&rsquo;t had the patience to read books, there were many brilliant fragments in that book, including one about fog.</p>
    <p>We sat there for a while, and then I had to go, I paid the bill, even though Mirka insisted on paying, and we walked out, said goodbye, I embraced her tightly, we arranged to meet another day, I was happy she wasn&rsquo;t leaving yet.</p>
    <p><i>Let your body go with the flow</i>, I hummed inside my head, rushing to catch a tram.</p>

    <div class="text-separator"></div>

    <p>Got off the tram, crossed the street, right in front of me there was Under the Lime Trees Estate, the housing estate I lived in, blue blocks of flats of Cosmonauts Estate loomed to the left, and behind my back, also to the left, stretched Wuthering Height Estate, full of cuboid blocks of flats that looked like they&rsquo;d been taken from late Malevich&rsquo;s paintings, the sky was less blue and more cloudy, but black cubes against a white background invariably hung under it, the lowest almost touching the tower block roofs, there were many cubes but at that time all single and separated by large distances.</p>
    <p>I walked along a four-floor block, there were trees, there was a parking lot, and I thought about Mirka, why she&rsquo;d decided to stay, because she&rsquo;d really wanted to leave, and I guessed it wasn&rsquo;t just the job offer she&rsquo;d got, there must have been something else that kept her in the city, but in my head most thoughts were on whether Kazik had already left or not yet and whether I would make it to say goodbye and how long he was going to be out of town and how I hated sleeping alone.</p>
    <p>While entering my block of flats, I remembered Mirka&rsquo;s story about some absurd emails she&rsquo;d kept receiving, saying she&rsquo;d been chosen and had some mission to accomplish, eventually she&rsquo;d stopped receiving them, at least hadn&rsquo;t mentioned them for a while, and then I thought that maybe she&rsquo;d made them all up, because it was such a strange story, and I was afraid that maybe she was slowly losing it, maybe it was all because of that coma, after all she&rsquo;d been through I&rsquo;d probably have gone crazy myself, especially as that prick Przemek had left her and vanished into the blue, fled somewhere, even his parents couldn&rsquo;t reach him, or maybe something bad had happened to him, I couldn&rsquo;t even remember the last time I&rsquo;d met him, anyway, it probably wasn&rsquo;t of any importance, I guess I kept thinking about all that just because I didn&rsquo;t want to think whether Kazik was still home or not, because my ground floor flat was only a couple of steps ahead, and I was somewhat nervous.</p>
    <p>The door was locked with both locks, a bad sign, I opened it, and the flat was indeed already empty, Kazik had left, oh well, I got upset, closed the door and went to the bathroom because after that beer my bladder was a bit full, and as I was standing over the bowl, I noticed that Kazik&rsquo;s toothbrush was missing from the cup on the basin.</p>
    <p>Of course it was missing, because in other cities people also need to brush their teeth, but then I got scared and thought that maybe he&rsquo;d left me, then I was mad at my brain and all the chemicals that governed it, at the fact that I panicked so easily whatever happened, even if nothing happened.</p>
    <p>Later I went to the kitchen to make something to eat, opened the cupboard, and there were only my mugs, only my plates and my pots were in the other cupboard, I went to the big room, and Kazik&rsquo;s clothes weren&rsquo;t in the wardrobe, Kazik&rsquo;s books and records weren&rsquo;t on the shelf, Kazik&rsquo;s papers weren&rsquo;t in the small room, where our desk stood.</p>
    <p>I remember that at that moment I thought about black cubes suspended in a white space, cubes which multiplied by two, that is, next to them, wall against wall, there appeared new cubes, creating aggregates of two, three, even four, until they formed something in the shape of a three-dimensional amoeba from <i>Boulder Dash</i>, engulfing more and more of the white space.</p>
    <p>But at that time all the cubes in the sky were still single, and there was no sign they were going to multiply, and I sat down on my bed, completely at a loss, and felt adrenaline released into the blood stream, a sudden lack of serotonin and dopamine in my brain and of all the other drugs one needs not to break down.</p>
    <p>I sat like that for a long time, and I guess it started getting dark, and I remained completely motionless, and my mind was blank, and I guess I wasn&rsquo;t thinking anything, although for quite a while I&rsquo;d been aware of a piece of paper lying on the table but didn&rsquo;t have the strength to stand up or maybe was just afraid to stand up and read it.</p>
    <p>The piece of paper said, I got to know that when I&rsquo;d finally found the courage to stand up and walk to the table, that Kazik hoped I wouldn&rsquo;t hold a grudge, that he had to leave and that he loved me, that he hoped we&rsquo;d still manage to find each other, but for the time being it wasn&rsquo;t an option, and that I shouldn&rsquo;t wait for him, that he had a very important mission very many things depended on, more important than anything else at that moment, and that I shouldn&rsquo;t try to contact him.</p>
    <p>Trying to contact him was the first thing I did, but he didn&rsquo;t pick up, then I tried once more but from a private number, so that he wouldn&rsquo;t know who was calling, but he didn&rsquo;t pick up anyway.</p>
    <p>It was already dark when I gave in, my mind was blank, or maybe I just don&rsquo;t recall now what I was thinking about, in a state of total confusion I went to the bathroom and poured some really hot water into the tub.</p>
    <p>Immersed myself in it, unwilling to think of anything for a while, blood vessels were dilating, and my head, making nothing of my willing, was still full of thoughts about Kazik, about why he had left, and where he could have gone, I thought I had to call each one of his friends and then thought about the day I was reading <i>Naked Lunch</i> and was somewhere halfway through, and Kazik said he had to go to the radio and would be back in a couple of hours, it was afternoon, it was about two years earlier, I couldn&rsquo;t focus on the book so decided to go out and kept wandering around the city for a long time, reached the city centre, reached The Old Brewery, a shopping centre in Półwiejska Street, and with headphones over my ears, the song was called <i>Hajnal</i>, I kept walking through its hallways, looking at shop windows.</p>
    <p>And then I saw him, Kazik was sitting at a table, eating some ciabatta or other rubbish, and in a chair on the opposite side of the table there was a man, young, probably not too tall, he had dark hair and little eyes, he was eating something as well, they talked, I never told Kazik I&rsquo;d seen them there.</p>
    <p>Once I got out of the tub, I grabbed the phone and stood in front of the window, it was already almost completely dark, a Społem shop, a primary school, a tower block, yet in the sky you could still see black cubes against an almost black background, my legs were shivering.</p>
    <p>I called each one of Kazik&rsquo;s friends whose number I knew, there weren&rsquo;t many, I called also those from the radio and learnt Kazik hadn&rsquo;t shown up for a month, others said they hadn&rsquo;t heard from him for two weeks or so, they were probably lying, he was probably hiding at someone&rsquo;s place, Kazik&rsquo;s parents were dead, I ran out of ideas.</p>
    <p>So I lay down on the bed, and it was dark, and I lay in the darkness, my wallpaper was also covered in small black squares, I knew I wouldn&rsquo;t fall asleep that night, felt a tightness in my chest, could barely breathe, it couldn&rsquo;t have been very late, I kept tossing and turning.</p>

    <div class="text-separator"></div>

    <p>Somehow I managed to fall asleep after all, woke up early in the morning, a chill woke me because I hadn&rsquo;t covered myself with the quilt, I could see the black geometrical pattern of the wallpaper, I thought I needed to see Mirka, but it was too early to text her.</p>
    <p>Started thinking about Kazik, maybe he was in some kind of trouble, &rsquo;cause he wouldn&rsquo;t have gone like that, maybe he&rsquo;d fallen foul of the mafia and had to leave the city or contracted HIV while drunk in some darkroom, and that was why, for my own good, he hadn&rsquo;t wanted to have sex and now had to go abroad to earn money for the expensive treatment.</p>
    <p>But in my head there was still a picture of him and that man in The Old Brewery, eating ciabatta or some other rubbish.</p>
    <p>I washed, ate something, took my mp3 player and went out, and while walking along blocks of flats, I imagined I was the hero of the game <i>Montezuma&rsquo;s Revenge</i> and completed one level after another, levels were coloured from purple to orange to green to red to black to pink, but the city was completely grey, in the sky there were grey clouds, grey blocks of flats and grey streets beneath them, there were black cubes in this sky, I looked carefully, in places there were two or three cubes adjoined side to side, then I remembered that dream and remembered <i>Boulder Dash</i>, and a chill ran down my spine.</p>
    <p>Most of the cubes, however, were still single at that time, I quickly changed songs on my player, but none matched my mood, until I finally happened upon <i>How to Disappear Completely, </i>and let it play, because I also wanted to completely vanish and I listened to it completely again and again, the blocks of flats ended, family houses began, some construction site, some car showroom, and then the tramway tracks took a turn, because I was following tracks, and then I walked along Winogrady Street, glancing around the sky, but at that moment the cubes didn&rsquo;t bother me as much as Kazik did.</p>
    <p>While crossing Army Poznań Street, enough with the whining, time for <i>Army of Me</i>, I finally remembered the last time I&rsquo;d seen Przemek.</p>
    <p>It was right after Mirka&rsquo;s collapse into the coma, the first weeks of that horrible half-year, I went to the block of flats in Wuthering Height Estate where Przemek lived, because he&rsquo;d called me first, and I was anxious to meet him, wanted to stop thinking about Mirka and all of that and had no pleasure in witnessing the extent of his despair, because he must have been in despair, at least that was what I thought, I remember being inside a lift going up to the tenth floor, it reeked inside the lift, and no sooner had I walked into Przemek&rsquo;s flat than he said we must go down to the garage.</p>
    <p>He was strangely excited, wearing an orange shirt, red hair peeked out of an unbuttoned collar, it was winter, and he didn&rsquo;t even put a jacket on, we took a lift down, barely spoke a word, went to the garages, it was snowing, Przemek opened the door and turned on the light.</p>
    <p>In the middle of the garage stood a strange vehicle, a bathyscaphe of sorts, its side was open, I could see billowing cables and strange mechanical parts, I was completely at a loss for what to say, while he, full of excitement, talked about his plan to rescue Mirka, said the vehicle was equipped with a grenade launcher, a circular saw on a boom, six protracting telescopic arms that helped you move when there was some occlusion.</p>
    <p>Completely at a loss for what to say, I stood there in silence, thinking maybe I should call his parents, I would have if only I&rsquo;d had their number, later on, after he&rsquo;d disappeared, I told myself he was a total fucker to have left Mirka like that, but all that time I&rsquo;d had a feeling that something wrong had happened to him.</p>
    <p>The bathyscaphe disappeared from the garage as suddenly as did Przemek, at least his parents said no word about it.</p>
    <p>I reached the city centre, went under a railway flyover, there was a fast tram flyover nearby, it was getting cold, it started to drizzle, again I listened to <i>How to Disappear Completely </i>and again thought only about Kazik, and the pavement was wet, and water was gathering in the gutter.</p>
    <p>Turned off the player, the beating down of the increasingly heavy rain, decided to call Kazik, but it went to voicemail, left no message, buildings, trees, getting closer and closer to a noisy crossroads.</p>
    <p>I forgot to mention that since the beginning of this story I had smoked almost a whole packet of cigarettes and while getting closer to the noisy crossroads, I lit another one, the rain tried to put it out, but it was smouldering soundly, nicotine thoroughly permeated the structure of my lungs, gradually released into the bloodstream, I spent the whole day aimlessly wandering around the city, managed to eat something at a milk bar, I also forgot to mention that Kazik, next to the piece of paper, left two thousand zloty, so that I wouldn&rsquo;t starve and could buy some cigs and alcohol, because he knew that without him I would smoke and drink big time, I managed to text Mirka to meet up, wasn&rsquo;t late this time, the place of our meeting was the tram stop by the Collegium Maius building.</p>
    <p>As I mentioned, this time I wasn&rsquo;t late, she embraced me tightly, and while walking towards the round Okrąglak building, we barely said a word, went inside some café with a large picture window, and could be seen drinking some espressos or lattes, or whatever we drank there, and we could see people passing by.</p>
    <p>First we didn&rsquo;t talk about Kazik, only about some general stuff, about that job Mirka was probably going to get, she was supposed to meet and talk details on the following day, and then, finally, we started speaking about Kazik, I told her everything, asked if he hadn&rsquo;t called, she said she was probably the last person he would have called, they weren&rsquo;t very fond of each other, she also said that maybe he had panicked, maybe he would come back after a while.</p>
    <p>We were silent for some time, drinking that coffee, we could be seen, and the people on the street were visible to us as well, tramways, Okrąglak, Gwarna Street, later she told me she thought someone was following her, that she&rsquo;d gone to a book store in the Old Market Square the day before to buy Pasewicz&rsquo;s poems, and some guy was following her, then she was walking down Półwiejska Street, he was walking down the street as well, when she went to her place in Lower Wilda Street, he watched her enter the building.</p>
    <p>I asked her what he&rsquo;d looked like, a short guy, she replied, but hooded, so she hadn&rsquo;t seen clearly, then she decided it might have had something to do with those emails she&rsquo;d received for a while, I didn&rsquo;t know what to think of that.</p>
    <p>We were silent for a while, then I decided we had to get drunk, I had to at least, and she could keep me company, she kept me company on the way to a pub, and while walking, we watched the sky, in which there were fewer and fewer single cubes and increasingly more black angular solids comprising two, three, four and even more cubes, we looked at them with anxiety, but didn&rsquo;t say a word.</p>
    <p>Going home inside a night bus, I was looking at trees.</p>

    <div class="text-separator"></div>

    <p>I had a dream the room I was sleeping in was being filled with water, I smoked some cigarettes in the morning, washed, didn&rsquo;t feel like eating, sat in front of the computer and kept sitting there for a long time, looking at numerous uninteresting websites, I even logged into my email account I hadn&rsquo;t used for ages.</p>
    <p>The spam folder was full of messages, I thought the mailbox should delete them by itself, but it hadn&rsquo;t, and since I had nothing better to do, I opened the folder and started browsing through, got to spam that was two years old, and between emails regarding penis enlargement and various financial lotteries I found one entitled <i>You have been chosen</i>:</p>
    <p><i>The times of Ragnarök are coming to your city, </i>read the strange email<i>, you are one of its guardians, you have a mission, you have to find the remaining five and coordinate their own missions, so when Ragnarök comes, they will build a new city in place of the old one, among the guardians is a woman who will bring the city to its doom, you have to find her first to postpone Ragnarök until you find the remaining guardians, soon you will receive further instructions.</i></p>
    <p>What a bunch of bollocks, I thought, but then remembered the emails Mirka talked about and felt uneasy, who could it be who had sent them, I decided to question Mirka about all this, it must have been someone we knew, someone was poking fun at us.</p>
    <p>I took the mp3 player, went outside, wind was blowing, it was drizzling, clouds were billowing, but right underneath the clouds hung formations composed of cubes, I couldn&rsquo;t count them, but there were already groups of ten and more, they hung above the blocks of flats, cast shadows, their clear edges stood out against the grey clouds, rain flowed down the smooth surfaces, I had the impression they were growing by the minute, and new cubes emerged, but I couldn&rsquo;t say for sure, because I never knew on which solid I should keep an eye.</p>
    <p>There might have been dozens of such solids above the housing estate alone, I could barely see single cubes, grey rain was falling, and there were grey clouds.</p>
    <p>I checked the time, it was already past ten, soaking up the rain, I dialled Mirka&rsquo;s number, it went to voicemail, tried again after a while, I had the Społem shop in front of me, voicemail again, more and more black shapes in the sky, maybe the black cubes really were forming a black amoeba taken from <i>Boulder Dash</i>, maybe, I thought, it would engulf more and more of the urban space.</p>
    <p>Then it was time for the city, tramways, rain, aimless wandering, listening to music, I kept looking up at the sky, where the angular black shapes were bigger and bigger and composed of more and more cubes and they took away more and more light, so it seemed as though storm clouds were coming, I dialled Mirka&rsquo;s number again and again and each time it only went to voicemail, I dialled Kazik&rsquo;s number, voicemail again.</p>
    <p>I had the keys to Mirka&rsquo;s flat and thought maybe I would go there, because I felt something bad had happened, though I was sure that it was just too much of some and too little of some other chemicals in the synapses of my brain, that in fact nothing had happened, there was rain, I kept thinking about Kazik, and it seemed as if I hadn&rsquo;t seen him for a long, long time.</p>
    <p>I remembered, as if through a fog, that we had watched some match, I hated matches, and right before the winning goal the screen had gone out and a fragment of some Japanese cartoon appeared, a landscape of blocks of flats, a woman in a long dress, she was hanging high up in the air with the dress touching the ground, her hair, even longer than the dress, was branched in a stellar fashion, waving like in Japanese cartoons, the woman had bright hair, her eyes were closed, cracks formed in the ground, light poured from the cracks, large chunks of the ground went in the air, buildings were turning to rubble, then the match switched back on.</p>
    <p>The city, the city centre, Mirka&rsquo;s block of flats not far ahead, I was hungry but decided to eat something later, thought about Kazik, listened to <i>Pluto</i>, the next thing I knew I was standing in front of the entrance.</p>
    <p>While opening her flat&rsquo;s door, after I had rung and rung, and no one had answered, I felt shivers running down my spine, the flat was empty, all her things were in their right places, evenly sorted out as they usually were at Mirka&rsquo;s, I could see blocks of flats through a window, went inside the room, a neatly made bed, net curtains, I went through papers piled on the desk, Mirka&rsquo;s CV, a cover letter to some company, the company&rsquo;s name was First Star Translations, there was no address, in the air there was this strange type of silence when you know that in a moment it will be that silent no longer.</p>
    <p>Behind my back the bathroom door burst open, someone ran out, I turned back, the entrance door was open wide, I slammed it closed while running out, a hooded guy in the corridor, he was running really fast, too many cigarettes, I won&rsquo;t reach him, I shouted at him, he ran even faster, then I chased him along the street, over both our heads there were black solids made of cubes and there were clouds, some Peaches song would make a perfect soundtrack to this chase, paving stones flashed beneath our feet, blood vessels were dilating, some special drugs started to release into the bloodstream, I had a body that felt no tiredness and eyes that could see in the dark, though it was light at that moment, but the one running before me, that hooded guy, didn&rsquo;t grow weaker either and didn&rsquo;t slow down, he ran a red light, I followed him, we found ourselves in front of The Old Brewery, I wondered how we&rsquo;d managed to get there so quickly, I was closer and closer, caught him by the hood, he turned back and broke free right away and vanished somewhere in the crowd, but I managed to see his face.</p>
    <p>It was that man with little eyes and dark hair I had seen with Kazik, two years earlier, while they were talking and eating some rubbish.</p>
    <p>Over Półwiejska Street, along its edges, right above the tenement houses, stretched a huge cloud composed of cubes, the cloud kept growing, I was short of breath.</p>
